-- 6.115 course description

The course description was so taintalizing I had to take it.  Having taken the
class, I think I'm qualified to say the description is completely accurate.

6.115 is possibly the hardest class you can take at MIT, but also the most
rewarding.

If the class you will spend all your time in lab.  But you will learn how to
build real things; there is really no substitute for the 6.115 way of just
doing it.

The class has 5 labs, and exam, and a free choice final project.  When you
finish the labs and exam, the professor takes out the class for a fancy dinner
and drinks.

For the final project I wanted to make a 24-bit color mechanically raster
scanned laser projector.  The basic idea is that you have an R, G, and B laser
diode put into a combinator (using half silvered mirrors) which can each be
pwm'ed with an 8 bit counter.  The light engine is directed at a mirror clad
disk which rotates at 24HZ+ to scan the laser across each pixel row.  I chose 8
rows for the design.  The raster scanner gets a sync pulse from an IR
LED/Phototransistor pair pointed at a reflective dot on the disk.  Graphics are
then double buffered on the chip and the pwm's are updated to match the sync
pulse for position.

Unfortunately, I didn't get my project working 100% -- diodes in my light
engine burned out and I didn't have enough time in the semester to debug all
the components, but I was really close and I learned a ton!

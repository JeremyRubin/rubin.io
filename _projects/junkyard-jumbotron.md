[The Junkyard Jumbotron](http://jumbotron.media.mit.edu/)
 lets you take a bunch of random 
displays and instantly stitch them together into a large, 
virtual display, simply by taking a photograph of them. It 
works with laptops, smartphones, tablets --- anything that 
runs a web browser. It also highlights a new way of connecting 
a large number of heterogenous devices to each other in the 
field, on an ad-hoc basis.

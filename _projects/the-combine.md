There's a problem brewing in America: the American way of life is facing an
attack which could shred the fundamental liberties and rights enjoyed by its
citizens to pieces. This attack is multifaceted, and comes not in the form of
boots on the ground, but a misalignment on the fundamental tenets of what is
required for free and open society.

Civic participation is down. Mistrust in the institutions which define our
society is up, and for good reason; the government is failing to serve and
protect its people. In the last decade or so, America has seen itself
embroiled in seemingly pointless wars, responding poorly to national disasters
like Hurricane Katrina, and mass surveillance programs have been revealed that
put theories the "tinfoil hat" theories to shame.

Can civic participation and trust be restored? While this is debated, at least
one small fact seems true: civic restoration cannot begin without first
responding to the attack.

How does one respond to an attack?

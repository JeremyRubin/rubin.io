I worked on Loupe when I interned at Nokia in the Summer of 2013. We published
a paper on it in UIST 2014.

> Loupe is a novel interactive device with a near-eye virtual display similar to
> head-up display glasses that retains a handheld form factor. We present our
> hardware implementation and discuss our user interface that leverages Loupe's
> unique combination of properties. In particular, we present our input
> capabilities, spatial metaphor, opportunities for using the round aspect of
> Loupe, and our use of focal depth. We demonstrate how those capabilities come
> together in an example application designed to allow quick access to
> information feeds.

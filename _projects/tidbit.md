I developed Tidbit for the [Node Knockout Hackathon](//nodeknockout.com/) in
November 2013 with some classmates. Tidbit uses a client's computer to mine for
Bitcoins as an alternative to website advertising. 

In December, the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs issued a subpoena to
me, requesting I turn over Tidbit's past and current source code, as well as
other documents and agreements with any third parties. It also issued 27
interrogatories -- formal written questions -- requesting additional documents
and ordering me to turn over information like the names and identities of all
Bitcoin wallet addresses associated with Tidbit, a list of all websites running
Tidbit's code and the name of anybody whose computer mined for Bitcoins through
the use of Tidbit, although Tidbit's code was not configured to mine for
Bitcoins. *

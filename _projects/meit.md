![MeIT in action]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.pic}})
This was my entry to MIT's 6.470 IAP competition. I've taken it offline, so it
is no longer available for use -- sorry!

MeIT has two main features, the namesake MeITup and the GeoNote. MeITups
provide a way for two interested parties to privately post missed connections.
The general public will never see your own MeITups except in aggregate form as
a part of the data visualizations. If and only if both users submit
intersecting MeITups information is exchanged. GeoNotes provide a public way to
share geographically tied messages. These postings are anonymous (unless you
choose to add in contact information) and will only be displayed on the map for
a couple of days. You can use a GeoNote for whatever you want - use it to let
people know where the party is at, pickup athletics, or even post about public
hazards.

The smell clock is a device I built for the Shenzhen manufacturing bootcamp.

It uses a 4x4 grid of individually controllable humidifiers connected to
bottles filled with different fragrances.

You can read more about the construction
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/07/06/sz-adventure-30). The comments here are
linked to that post.

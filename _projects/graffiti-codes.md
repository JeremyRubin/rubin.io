Grafitti codes allow users to encode a 
small piece of information into a physical space. It uses 
accelerometer based paths to unlock data. These paths can be 
drawn onto any surface with analouge tools (such as marker) and 
scanned by tracing them over with a mobile phone. Repo 
available 
[here](https://github.com/JeremyRubin/Graffiti-codes).

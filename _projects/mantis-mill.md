![Image of Koch Snowflake being drawn]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.pic}})
More of a social hack than anything -- my Senior year at Exeter I built a 3-D
printer for my advanced studio art class.  The photo shows it plotting a Koch
Snowflake with a pen taped on (it has a mandril too, I just lack pretty
pictures of it).

 designed the Mantis 9 and certainly gave me a lot of help!

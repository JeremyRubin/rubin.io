Federation is an amazingly powerful tool in a system designerâ€™s tool belt.
This work provides a unifying definition for federated. In abbreviation: a
system is federated when there are multiple providers of an identical (or
nearly identical), interoperable service. The federated paradigm offers much
improved fault tolerance, liberty, and privacy over centralized alternatives.
The federated paradigm applies to all sorts of systems, from governmental to
web services. However, this paradigm seems to be unsustainable, either
devolving into centralized systems or being outpaced by them. In this paper, I
will delve into multiple examples of federated systems, exploring their
successes and failures, as well as delving into what caused the decay of these
systems. In reflection, I will also provide several suggestions on how
system developers might harden their use of this paradigm.

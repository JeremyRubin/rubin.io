I was very proud to have served as Program Chair for the 2015 Scaling Bitcoin conference in Montreal.

> Scalability is not a single parameter; there are many opportunities to make
> the Bitcoin protocol more efficient and better able to service the needs of
> its growing userbase. Each approach to further scaling the Bitcoin
> blockchain involves implicit trade offs of desired properties of the whole
> system. As a community we need to raise awareness of the complex and subtle
> issues involved, facilitate deeper research and testing of existing
> proposals, and motivate future work in this area.

>In the context of modern cryptosystems, a common theme is the creation of
>distributed trust networks. In most of these designs, permanent storage of a
>contract is required. However, permanent storage can become a major
>performance and cost bottleneck. As a result, good code compression schemes
>are a key factor in scaling these contract based cryptosystems. For this
>project, we formalize and implement a data structure called the Merkelized
>Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST) to address both data integrity and compression.

The 500SW was a project I built 
with the other Nokia interns. It  
was a 6 ingredient Barbot which 
delivered drinks in exchange for 
dancing. The 500SW went to the 
[SF BarBot 2013](//www.barbot.us/)
 competition, and it 
caught some good press (Hackaday, 
Popular Science, etc). More info 
(and repository) 
[here](//500sw.github.io/intro/)

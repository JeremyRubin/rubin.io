>6.175 is a new subject to learn the fundamental principles of computer
>architecture via implementation of different versions of pipelined machines
>with caches, branch predictors and virtual memory. Emphasis on writing and
>evaluating architectural descriptions that can be both simulated and
>synthesized into real hardware or run on FPGAs. The use and design of test
>benches. Weekly labs. Intended for students who want to apply computer science
>techniques to complex hardware design.

>Topics include combinational circuits including adders and multipliers, multi-
>cycle and pipelined functional units, RISC Instruction Set Architectures
>(ISA), non-pipelined and multi-cycle processor architectures, 2-to-10 stage
>in-order pipelined architectures, processors with caches and hierarchical
>memory systems, TLBs and page faults, I/O interrupts.

For our final project, we implemented a cache-coherent multicore processor with a dedicated message passing bus to bypass cache coherence overhead.

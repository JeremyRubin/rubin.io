The Digital Currency Initiative is a research community at the MIT Media Lab
focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

I Co-Founded the DCI with [Joi Ito](https://joi.ito.com) to support open source
core developers, research scientists, and students committed to harnessing
these technologies for the public good.

I recruited [Neha Narula](http://nehanarula.org) to be the Director of the DCI and have
been continually impressed with the quality of work she has put in to making
the DCI a smashing success. If you ever read this Neha... <3!

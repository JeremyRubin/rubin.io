Abstract:

> Many mechanisms exist in centralized systems that incentivize resource
> utilization. For example, central governments use inflation for many reasons,
> but a common justification for inflation in practice is as a means to
> incentivize resource utilization. Incentives to utilize resource may stimulate
> economic growth. However, the asymmetry of economic control and potential
> abuses of power implicit in centralized systems may be undesirable. An
> electronic cash design may be able to create resource utilization incentives via
> decentralized mechanisms. Decentralized mechanisms may be economically
> sustainable without centralized and potentially coercive forces. 
> 
> We propose
> Hourglass, a novel electronic cash design that provides a decentralized
> mechanism to encourage utilization via expiration dates. Constructed in this
> way, decentralized utilization incentives may have less potential for coercive
> abuses than more centralized methods, but may be similarly effective in their
> ability to incentivize utilization. We present the Hourglass system at multiple
> levels of detail: a design overview, a minimal kernel framework, a series of
> descriptive refinements, and a concrete implementation as a fork of Bitcoin (a
> popular electronic cash protocol in common use). We also present several
> potential applications of Hourglass, such as renewable resource markets,
> spectrum allocation, stock issuance, and currency.

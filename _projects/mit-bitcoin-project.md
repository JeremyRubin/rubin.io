The MIT Bitcoin Project was an initiative I launched with Dan Elitzer to give
every MIT student $100 in Bitcoin 

Along the way, we ran several other initiatives to drive engagement, such as a
3-phase hackathon, a top-notch conference, and a series of lectures for
developers.

We successfully distributed the bitcoin this past fall, and are eagerly waiting
to report the results

        Printing Press Tour
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 11</h4>


    <span class="post-date">17 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Today we got to see a printing press. Printing presses are pretty cool; they’re a pretty old technology which one might
argue was the driving force behind the renaissance.</p>

<h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>

<p>Printing presses are fast. If you’re looking to get something made at one of these factories, you need to order at least something
like 10,000 copies because it prints that many in about the time they can turn the machine on and off.</p>

<h2 id="gold-leafing">Gold Leafing</h2>

<p>One of the coolest processes we got to see at the factory was how they gold-leaf page edges.</p>

<p>Basically, they sand down the edges of a block of paper to be super smooth.</p>

<p>And then they press a piece of foil onto it.</p>

<p>The result is very shiny!</p>

<h2 id="paper-cutter">Paper Cutter</h2>

<p>Imagine cutting a piece of paper. Now two pieces. Four? 16? 32? At a certain point, the paper becomes too thick to easily cut.</p>

<p>Now imagine you aren’t just trying to cut it, but you’re try to make a perfect edge, uniformly.</p>

<p>At a printing press, they cut thousands of sheets simultaneously. That requires a really sharp knife, a lot of pressure, and a highly attentive worker.</p>

<p>At the factory, pages are typically cut twice. The first time is to cut to the general size of the job and the second time is done as a trim on the finished product to remove the edges.</p>

<h2 id="binding">Binding</h2>

<p>These big rotary machines are used to bind pages</p>

<h2 id="special-requests">Special Requests</h2>

<p>Printing presses – or at least this very awesome one – can accommodate a lot of special requests.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of special processes</p>

  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 9</h4>


    <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Today we wrapped up our electrical changes to the orchard board. At the end of
the day, we submitted our boards for Engineering Queries and price quotes.</p>

<p>I also added some sweet graphics to my board, this is what is will look like:</p>

<p><img src="https://shenzhenadventure.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/boardtop.png?w=271" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="https://shenzhenadventure.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/boardbottom.png?w=261" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>One thing people often ask is how bad the pollution is… Actually Shenzhen is
basically a physically greener city than any other I’ve been to and the air is
very clear. Of course, some days are better than others, today was particularly
clear. What does suck is that everyone is smoking everywhere; that is probably
worse for the air quality than other factors.</p>

<p>After work, we went out to dinner at Coco Park, the notorious clubbing part of
Shenzhen. We didn’t go clubbing, but we went to a pretty western-menued bar
&amp; grill for beers and dinner.</p>

        Security via Glitter

  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 9</h4>


    <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>So you find yourself in China, and you want to go out in the evening. How can you be sure that your electronics aren’t tampered with?</p>

<p>Use tamper evident seals!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uo0cpvfybqm8j7m/glitter_sealed.jpeg?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Basically you go and buy a big plastic bin, tape over the edges,
paint glitter nailpolish over the tape, and take a picture. You can’t get into the box without destroying the seals/re-aligning them perfectly.</p>

<p>“Reasonably Secure”</p>

        Hard Earned Day Off
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 8</h4>


    <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Today was basically a day off, I answered emails and worked on a small project,
as well as doing a couple edits to my board design to get feedback from Bunnie.</p>

<p>In the evening, we went to get dinner at a Pakistani restaurant. After dinner,
Akiba led us on his ritual treat; Mango slushies and foot massages. I didn’t
get many photos of the massage, but it was pretty awesome. For about 10 USD,
you get an hour massage.</p>

<p>First, you take a long tea-foot bath. After brewing for a few minutes, you plop
your feet out and the massage begins. They start by filing down your feet and
chiseling them to get rid of dead skin and callouses. Then you get some
standard massage-y stuff. Then, it gets interesting. The masseuse pulls out a
small torch and lights it on fire. Then, she quickly flips a glass cup over the
flame (which is held dangerously close…) and slips it on your foot and
suckers it off. This is the famed practice of cupping. After doing lots of
quick cups, some larger ones are placed on and left to sit for a few minutes.
These ones really hurt! Actually, come to think of it most of the massage
hurt… Anyways, after cupping the remainder of the massage was fairly normal.
My feet felt pretty fucking awesome afterwards, not bad for 65 RMB.</p>

        Intro to Bootcamp Project

  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 6, 7</h4>


    <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Friday and Saturday were free form days, we just worked on our projects for the most part.</p>

<p>Our projects are basically to doing a small customization to the Orchard platform, which the instructors designed. In a nutshell:</p>
<blockquote>Orchard is a low-power, multi-band radio-connected embedded computing solution. In other words, it's an IoT platform.

Orchard is open source hardware and software.

Orchard is also a supply chain solution. Derivatives of Orchard are meant to be prototyped easily and brought to volume manufacturing with less effort than typical. Unlike breadboard solutions like Arduino, Orchard is targeted toward prototyping through board spins. This is possible thanks to China's low-cost prototyping infrastructure. The effort to prototype is higher than a breadboard, but the on-ramp to scale production once you've got your design finished is also less steep.</blockquote>

<p>Orchard is really cool, you can read more about it <a href="http://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Orchard_Main_Page">here</a>.</p>

<p>My customization is adding a sensor chip called an APDS 9960. It’s a hell of a sensor: it can do ambient light, proximity, and gesture sensing baked into a tiny tiny package and communicates over I2C.</p>

<p><img src="https://shenzhenadventure.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/apds9960.png" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Originally I was going to try to do a radio astronomy antenna on the board, so that you could chuck out a bunch of orchard boards in a field and make a radio telescope, but getting the RF engineering correct was going to be too difficult for the scope of the course and my background in said materials.</p>

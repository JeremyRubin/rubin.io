  <h4>On Your Mark Get Set GOOOOOO</h4>


    <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2022</span>

    <p>Other people have followed this tutorial with some success:</p>

<p>Common sticking points include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Not building latest sapio binary before starting</li>
  <li>Not building latest sapio-studio project before starting</li>
  <li>Not having the correct clang version (&gt;=12)</li>
  <li>brew installing clang somewhere else (try /opt/homebrew, but also /usr/local/Cellar)</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<ol>
  <li>Set up a signet node.</li>
</ol>

<p>Build this branch https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/checktemplateverify-signet-23.0-alpha</p>

<p>You’ll likely want settings like this in
   your bitcoin.conf too:</p>

  <li>You’ll need to create a new wallet, if you’ve not done it before</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get coins to your address https://faucet.ctvsignet.com/ / DM me for more</p>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the install instructions on
https://learn.sapio-lang.org/ch01-01-installation.html You can skip the the
sapio-studio part / pod part and just do the Local Quickstart up until

  <li>run cargo build –release from the root directory to build the sapio-cli.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="start-up-sapio-studio">Start Up Sapio Studio</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install">Yarn</a></li>
  <li>Install Sapio Studio
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone <span class="nt">--depth</span> 1 git@github.com:sapio-lang/sapio-studio.git <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>sapio-studio

    <p>Leave that running in  tab</p>
  </li>
  <li>Start electron server
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yarn start-electron

  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once it launches this is what you should see:
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/1-sapio-studio-init.png" alt="" />
Go ahead and click on settings to configure the sapio cli for the first time.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.16.35-AM.png" alt="" />
First, let’s configure our sapio-cli. Go head and do “Configured Here” and leave
everything blank. Click on the select file and point sapio studio to your (freshly done) release build of sapio-cli.</p>

<p>Click Save Settings.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.17.37-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, you should see the following confirmation.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.18.09-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next let’s configure your node. Clikc select file and point it to your
.cookie file and then configure the node as Signet &amp; set the RPC port to whatever you used. Save it.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.18.59-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click test connection – it should tell you… something.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.19.39-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigate back to wallet. You should see some balance or something (assuming you did the faucet).
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.20.12-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next, click “Load WASM Plugin” and find your plugin-example/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/*.wasm files. Go ahead and pick the jamesob vault one.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.20.41-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next, click Create new contract.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.21.17-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll see a little applet for the JameVault. Look at that handsome guy!
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.22.07-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next, we need to create some Taproot keys for this – gonna need some command line action:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./bitcoin-cli <span class="nt">-signet</span> getaddressinfo <span class="si">$(</span>./bitcoin-cli <span class="nt">-signet</span> getnewaddress <span class="s2">"vault_project"</span> <span class="s2">"bech32m"</span><span class="si">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then copy the witness program. do this twice – one for cold one for hot.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.27.25-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now click on your applet and start filling it out. You can get new addresses by clicking on Bitcoin Node (just not keys yet)
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.35.18-AM.png" alt="" />
n.b. sometimes things are in btc, sometimes in sats. c’est la vie.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.35.48-AM.png" alt="" />
finish up and click submit
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.36.02-AM.png" alt="" />
If all is right, you should see a contract get created!
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.36.17-AM.png" alt="" />
To actually create it, click on the parent txn and then sign it…
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.36.51-AM.png" alt="" />
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.37.00-AM.png" alt="" />
and then broadcast it (with real money you’ll want to verify before doing this)
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.37.03-AM.png" alt="" />
it’ll now pop up in the mempool.</p>

<p>n.b. BUG ALERT: the viewer on the right hand side is a little glitchy. before playing
with the psbts/txn signing logic, always close it and re-open by clicking on the txn 
you want.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.37.14-AM.png" alt="" />
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.37.25-AM.png" alt="" />
Now you can click on the begin redeem txn and broadcast and sign that one so it’s in the mempool
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.44.38-AM.png" alt="" />
Click on the updatable output, and you’ll see some options.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-10.44.57-AM.png" alt="" />
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-11.53.45-AM.png" alt="" />
click on spend hot, and fill out the form. Hit submit, and then hit recompile.</p>

<p>Be sure to pick an amount that is amount in input - fee (todo: make this smarter!).
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-11.53.54-AM.png" alt="" />
if all is well, you’ll see a hot spend.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-11.47.10-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>if you picked a relative timelock &gt; 1 block, try playing with the simulate tab :D.</p>

<p>If you navigate back to the CONTRACTS tab you can pull up contracts you previously made /
recompilations with effects, even across sessions.
<img src="/public/img/bitcoin/sapio-studio-tut-ctv6/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-11.47.20-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

        RoadMap or Load o' Crap?

  </h2>
  <h4>Day 27: Rubin's Bitcoin Advent Calendar</h4>


    <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2021</span>

    <p><em>Welcome to day 27 of my Bitcoin Advent Calendar. You can see an index of all
the posts <a href="/advent21">here</a> or subscribe at
<a href="https://judica.org/join">judica.org/join</a> to get new posts in your inbox</em></p>

<p>I know, I know.</p>

<p>God forbid, a roadmap. People hate roadmaps. As I’ve noted
<a href="/blog/2021/07/02/covenants/">before</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bitcoin Eschews Roadmaps and Agendas.</strong>
I provide this maxim to make clear that this document is by no means an official
roadmap, narrative, or prioritization. However, it is my own assessment of what
the current most pragmatic approach to upgrading Bitcoin is, based on my
understanding of the state of outstanding proposals and their interactions.</p>

  <p>My priorities in producing this are to open a discussion on potential new
features, risk minimization, and pragmatic design for Bitcoin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you didn’t click, I definitely recommend reading <a href="/blog/2021/07/02/covenants/">the quoted
post</a> in conjunction with this one. As well as, if
you’re a first time visitor to the Advent Calendar, the preceding 26 posts.</p>

<hr />

<p>In contrast to my prior post, this roadmap is going to be less about full
justifications and unbiased weightings and tallyings of sentiments and more just
me spitting out a timeline we could introduce changes on. It’s not a final
answer, and in no way authoritative, but it’s a launch point for a discussion
that has to happen in some way at some point in order to advance a soft-fork.</p>

<p><em>Consider this as being posted for the sake of public review. If you disagree
with this, let me know why! But please no attacks just for the act of discussing
the topic of soft-fork activation<sup id="fnref:ordo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ordo" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</em></p>

<p>So buckle up here’s how we could make Bitcoin kick ass in 2022 and beyond:</p>

<h1 id="2022-the-year-of-the-covenant">2022: The Year of the Covenant</h1>

<h2 id="bip-119-timeline">BIP-119 Timeline</h2>
<p>CheckTemplateVerify is getting close to ready to go. There are numerous
<a href="https://utxos.org/signals">supporters (listed on utxos.org)</a>, few detractors,
and a bumper crop of amazing use cases (did you read the calendar?) waiting for
us on the other side of CTV activation. The major critiques are that we might want
something that does ‘more’ than CTV itself, or to include it in a bundle of
things.</p>

<p>My take: we’re not Gordon Gecko. Greed is <em>Not</em> Good. CTV represents a clean, well
contained, unproblematic upgrade that’s going to deliver hella functionality in
service of scaling, decentralization, self custody, and privacy. Let’s secure
the bag for Bitcoin users everywhere and make it happen. We can always do more,
later, informed by what extensions we need for rapidly maturing tools like
Sapio. CTV is also technically specified and implemented sufficiently – a view
I’ve confirmed with a couple other devs – that it is able to be considered for
release.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-have-to-happen-to-release-ctv">What would have to happen to release CTV?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>More signalers would need to be on
<a href="https://utxos.org/signals">utxos.org/signals</a> or other platforms to demonstrate
interest and demand for CTV, ideally explaining which use cases are important to
them and why. Every voice counts for consensus. There is no list long enough to
capture what it would mean to have consensus, so there is not some threshold
that implies a ‘go ahead’, but N+1 is clearly better than N.</li>
  <li>More “regular contributors” would need to spend time reviewing the code and BIP to
assure themselves of correctness and safety.  Nothing can move forward with out,
no matter the count of casual contributors. Many regular contributors don’t want
to ‘get political’ and look at forks. Fortunately, while all consensus changes
are complex, CTV is a very tiny and easy to review change in comparison with
SegWit or Taproot (more similar to CheckLockTimeVerify – a couple hundred lines
of consensus code, a couple hundred lines of non consenus code, and a couple
thousand lines of tests, no cryptographic primitives). <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a big
if!  Every contributor has the right to review, and ACK or provide a reasoned
NACK.  Even if everyone else is excited about something doesn’t mean there isn’t
space for new thought-through dissent. At the end of the article, I discuss
some concrete next steps to ensure more developer review occurs.</li>
  <li>We would need to merge the implementation. This is simple, but enough ACKs have to
come in and rebases on other subsequent changes to get it in. This can
happen ahead of ‘full consensus’ since there are no deployment parameters,
but aids in increasing the testing priority of CTV.</li>
  <li>We would need to get a majority of miners/pools primed to accept the upgrade.</li>
  <li>Major alternative implementation maintainers (e.g., BTCD, Knots) should show
willingness to implement or accept patches for the new rules (although it’s a
soft-fork, this is good to do).</li>
  <li>We would need to decide on release parameters for the implementation.</li>
  <li>We would need to merge and release a client with release parameters</li>
  <li>The client would needs to lock-in by a supermajority of miners signalling.</li>
  <li>Then, and only then, would CTV be fully available.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="whats-the-maximally-aggressiveoptimistic-timeline">What’s the Maximally Aggressive/Optimistic Timeline?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Soft Signals / Developer Review: 2-3 months required to get ACKs on the
implementation, assuming no major changes required.</li>
  <li>Merge: Instant, just whenever there are ACKs against the implementation being
safe and matching BIP. Usually, enough ACKs for a PR is 2 regular contributors,
the comitter, and a maintainer, but for consensus changes there is no threshold
at which Bitcoin considers a change sufficiently peer reviewed. A consensus
change should see higher quality reviews, as well as external consensus that the
change is desired.</li>
  <li>Getting miners primed to signal: ~20% of pools are on
<a href="https://utxos.org/signals">utxos.org/signals</a>, more should be coming on board
soon. Don’t expect this to take additional time if in conjunction with Developer
review.</li>
  <li>Debating Timelines: ~1 month to agree on a release timeline</li>
  <li>Preparing a release: ~1 month to do release candidates and testing.</li>
  <li>Speedy Trial: 3 months of signalling, 3 months of waiting for lock-in to active.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="overall-it-could-look-like-this">Overall, it could look like this:</h3>

<p>On March 15th developers reach agreement on merging BIP-119’s implementation.
On April 15th, agreement is reached on release parameters for signalling from ~
June 1st to ~September 1st. The activation height would be November 10th.  A client
is prepared, and tested, and released. No issues are found. The miners signal at
some point in the 3 month window above the threshold. CTV locks-in. Developers
can prep wallet software for deeper integration. CTV activates before
Thanksgiving, avoiding the “dire straits” of
thanksgiving-hanukkah-christmas-chinese-new-year-valentines-day season.</p>

<p><em>but that’s basically identical to Taproot’s timeline?</em></p>

<p>Exactly. If we act on this timeline starting in early January 2022, it is
possible to meet an almost identical timeline for CTV as Taproot.</p>

<p>Part of why it works is that the next major release is scheduled for 2022-04-01.
Soft forks are usually released as a minor patch on top of a few recent major
releases. So CTV could be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Code included in 23.0 for CTV, no activation parameters</li>
  <li>Activation parameters in 23.1, and backported to 22.x, 21.x, and (really this is up to maintainers how far to backport!).</li>
  <li>23.1 released before June 1st, 2022.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What could go wrong?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Concern:</strong> There could be  a small tweak to CTV that makes it marginally
better, and it’s worth adding some extra review time as a result.<br />
<strong>Rebuttal:</strong><br />
<em>CTV is highly design specific, so it’s unlikely there could be a change needed,
but not impossible. Changes would be unlikely to be large, though, e.g. perhaps
comitting to the same fields in a different order. Taproot saw some small
changes about a month before being merged.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Concern:</strong> Release process has a delay due to an issue uncovered in non-CTV code.<br />
<strong>Rebuttal:</strong><br />
<em>Soft fork releases are usually a minor patch onto an existing version, so it’s
unlikely that there would be a new bug, but the release would still be planned
and could resume as soon as patched. Speedy Trial’s ‘delayed activation’ also
helps with providing more time for (non-consensus) bug fixes in the client
between lock-in and activation.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Concern:</strong> Release process has a delay due to an issue uncovered in CTV’s code.<br />
<strong>Rebuttal:</strong><br />
<em>If the issue is a bug, it would merit more strict scrutiny on the code and
tests (which are pretty comprehensive currently) as to how they could be passing
with an issue like that. Once patched and reviewed, it’s still possible to merge
and release. However, the issue could also be a conceptual bug (e.g., here’s how
to do recursive covenants with CTV), which would certainly delay (and I’d be the
first to say it!) continuing with CTV at the present time. The former issue is
likely more likely than the latter, and that risk is defrayed by thorough code
review and testing.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Concern:</strong> There’s not enough developer consensus conceptually.<br />
<strong>Rebuttal:</strong><br />
<em>There are many developers supporting on
<a href="https://utxos.org/signals">utxos.org/signals</a>. I’ve also made an effort to
reach out to a variety of developers who are not on the site to seek out
dissent, and I do not think there are any current safety concerns, which is
positive for developers who might not Ack but don’t have a ‘this is a grave
mistake’ Nack up their sleeves. Again, there’s no well defined threshold for
what is “enough”.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Concern:</strong> Miners don’t want CTV and don’t signal for it.<br />
<strong>Rebuttal:</strong><br />
_20% of the hash pools already say they do want it, and more should be joining
that list soon™. Should that not happen, there could be a UASF effort to ensure
the activation of BIP-119 if users want CTV strongly enough. _</li>
  <li><strong>Concern:</strong> Disagreement on Activation mechanism.<br />
<strong>Rebuttal:</strong><br />
<em>Taproot’s Speedy Trial (ST) worked very well. Big Success. No need to mess with
the recipe. UASF-clienters know how to make the mods to the activation logic for
whatever they want as a competing client. But perhaps that’s not a comfortable
status quo, so this is certainly one to watch. I’ve made my own remarks on what
order of operations I think ST/UASF/etc should go in
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018833.html%5C">here</a>,
but there’s not consensus on this topic. Notably, there is some dissent from
reusing ST at all. While important, activation logic is a secondary (but still
critical) concern to the decision to accept the current specification and
implementation of CTV in the first place, and discussion on that can proceed
in parallel to progress on consensus on the implementation.</em></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="and-then-what">And Then What?</h2>

<p>After the release of CTV Soft Fork Client, what goes next?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Jeremy takes a vacation for a month.</li>
  <li>Sapio continues to improve dramatically, as detailed in the last post.</li>
  <li>Work begins on new Opcodes.</li>
  <li>More fun applications get built on CTV/Sapio (for examples, review the entire series of
<a href="/advent21">the Advent Calendar</a>, but a few of my favorites are <a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/10/advent-13/">Payment
Pools</a>,
<a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/07/advent-10/">Vaults</a>, and <a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/17/advent-20/">Bonded
Oracles</a>).</li>
  <li>Non-Interactive Lightning Channel BOLT drops.</li>
  <li>Payment Pool spec drops with LN integration.</li>
  <li>(Privacy + Scale)++</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="new-opcodes-you-say">New Opcodes you say?</h2>

<p>Yep, new opcodes. As soon as CTV is merged, there are some new features that
could be tooled into BIPs without much controversy, given their simplicity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>New Math Opcodes</li>
  <li>OP_AMOUNT</li>
  <li>OP_CSFS</li>
</ol>

<p>These are “universally agreed on” bits of functionality that have very little
wiggle room in how they might be specified. Therefore their implementation,
testing, and release is mostly mechanical. This makes them good bets for a
concrete timeline because they’re a rote-development task with few research
dependencies and easily agreed on design.</p>

<p>With hard work, these could be reviewed and tested in time for Speedy Trial
signalling in June 2023 (+1 year), with realllllly hard work 6 months earlier
(but there are conflicting priorities for developer’s time – e.g., building
stuff with/for CTV and Taproot – that make that super unlikely).</p>

<h3 id="what-about-anyprevout">What about Anyprevout</h3>

<p>Anyprevout is 1000000% not ruled out here for advancing to the consensus stage
in 2022. There are a couple things happening on Anyprevout that make me suspect
it might be more primed towards early-mid 2024 best case.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Taproot upgraded channels taking some steam away from Eltoo with AJ’s
proposal to do state compaction via PTLCs.</li>
  <li>Disagreement over no justice transactions in the community for high value
channels.</li>
  <li>Open research on specific Eltoo protocol implementation / need for other
tools (like SIGHASH_BUNDLE).</li>
  <li>Lack of an open PR and test suite for it.</li>
  <li>CSFS + CTV permitting a version of Eltoo.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these reasons point to it being highly unlikely APO could be finished on
the timeline presented for CTV, but also that given a desire to see a working LN
client (ensuring the protocol is sound end-to-end without modifications) leads
to additional engineering complexity.</p>

<p>I’ve heard on the rumour vine some excellent engineers might start working on an
Eltoo implementation, I believe that work to be of tremendous value to gain
consensus on deploying anyprevout.</p>

<p>Given that a couple years seems like the best case for a set of upgrades around
APO to deliver Eltoo, if we have the ability to deliver CTV now, it is a good
asymmetric bet for delivering utility to Bitcoin’s users.</p>

<p>Suppose I’m wrong, and Anyprevout really could get done in 2022. Shouldn’t it
be ‘next’ and CTV can wait?</p>

<p>The notion that any soft-fork is “next” for consideration and blocks any other
from being considered is somewhat contrary to the support for parallel
soft-forks with distinct version bits used for signalling. The possibility of
deploying soft forks on independent bits means things can be ultimately
“proposed” whenever they’re mature enough to enter the “final stage” and the
timing fits with Bitcoin’s general release schedule. The chief counterarguments
to this are twofold: One, review resources are finite and we can’t even think
about \(&gt;1\) thing at a time; Two, it’s bad if the protocol is simultaneously
deploying \(N\) upgrades and any of them might fail, leading to \(2^N\)
potential protocol states. It’s actually the other way around: if things can
proceed in parallel we can get more review, because developers won’t feel that
reviewing others work has the potential to slow down their own, and we’ll be
more certain that the upgrades we release are strongly desired by the community
(i.e., will end in a UASF if not activated due to miner apathy).</p>

<h3 id="what-about-tapleafupdateverify">What about TapLeafUpdateVerify</h3>

<p>If I had to estimate, I’d say TLUV needs another year or so of people ‘stewing’
on the possibilities and design before it could move forward. It would then
probably need at least a year of tinkering to get a well-accepted
implementation, and then a year for release process. So let’s say best case it
could be a 2024 thing, more likely 2025 given Anyprevout is seen as higher
priority for the engineering work.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-inherited-ids-iids">What about Inherited IDs (IIDs)?</h3>

<p>They didn’t make the cut in the earlier piece since they’re a bit more abstract,
but I’d posit that IIDs could also approach a 2024 timeline were the developer
of the idea to spend a heckin’ big amount of time on advocacy for the concept in
2022, and present a clean implementation of the concept (&amp; demonstration of
overheads) by 2023. This is complicated by the issue that he would have to also
solve issues with requiring a new index, such as helping assist assumeutxo
compatibility, write reindexing logic from genesis (or somehow exclude old
coins?), and also work on utreexo compatibility. Those all seem tractable,
but very hard to do for someone who is not a full-time long-time contributor
to the project, but I’m a believer that the job could be done given the quality
of the insights in the IIDs paper.</p>

<h2 id="parallel-developments">Parallel Developments?</h2>

<p>In parallel to the above, there are some things that I think are <em>very cool</em>
that should remain under development, but don’t have a clear path to inclusion
presently.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-September/018168.html">Transaction Sponsorship</a>, which could substantially 
simplify many protocols on top of Bitcoin, especially things like Eltoo and CTV
stuff. We can’t predict that too well because it will depend on what developers
end up running up against with current best practices around CPFP/RBF, but
I suspect it might become popular if a small group of developers prioritizes
such an approach as a unified front. Since it’s technically simple, it wouldn’t
take much time to implement, but because there’s very little consensus for
it right now it’s not fit for inclusion in a roadmap.</p>

<p>The next is <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/en-simplicity-github/">Simplicity</a>. Simplicity could completely change how Bitcoin
scripting works and is super duper exciting. I guess it’s going out on Elements
sometime soon? However, it’s stupidly complicated for most devs to fully
understand (although it is called simplicity…), so it would take a fair
amount of time (read: years) before the implementation could be sufficiently
independently reviewed by the intersection of qualified Bitcoin and Programming
Language theory reviewers. The interesting thing about Simplicity with respect
to this roadmap is that because it’s so general, as soon as it seems like
Simplicity would be on Bitcoin within ~1.5 years, it’s likely all other
scripting soft fork developers would “stop” development<sup id="fnref:note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:note" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and focus on
deployment as Simplicity Jets.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="concrete-next-steps">Concrete Next Steps</h1>
<p>Should this plan not seem feasible to the near unanimity of the community for us
the deliver on (e.g., with +2-3 months of the suggested timeline), I don’t think
there is another good opportunity to enact on an activation of CTV and the best
course of action would be to delay +1 year. There could be a UASF for it, since
there is strong user demand for CTV, but I wouldn’t personally lead the charge
on that beyond ensuring that the BIP-119 code remains up-to-date and is
implemented correctly.</p>

<p>Assuming someone doesn’t make a bold argument that gives me or the aggregate
current supporters of CTV pause, I plan to begin holding a fortnightly CTV
review session to iron out any details, additional testing, code review, and
activation plans. I would also like to help a third party host a <a href="https://bitcoincore.reviews">review
club</a>, although the focus of Review Club is more
educational for the reviewers as opposed to for the purpose of formally
reviewing the code for merge.</p>

<hr />

<p>You’ve now reached the end of Rubin’s Bitcoin Advent Calendar, 2021! Congrats.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc -w $(ls | grep advent)</code> tells me that means you read 50,773 words total of
me rambling on about covenants. That’s PhD thesis length! I really hope you
found something to enjoy.</p>

<p>A special thanks to all who helped review this post in particular and provided
feedback in ensuring I’ve done an OK job capturing the complexity of gaining
consensus. To the extent that I haven’t succeeded in representing your
perspectives here, I take sole responsibility for the inadequacy. Your
constructive feedback on how to improve is welcomed. A further special thanks to
Ryan Gentry who encouraged me to produce the series in the first place, and to
Sarah Satoshi for her support as I battled my way through this task.</p>

<p>As for me, I’m off to sip some Eggnog and eat some holiday cookies! I’ll take a
little bit of a break, and be back in the New Year following up on next steps
and dropping fresh content for y’all as always.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Years,</p>

<p>Sapio began as little more than a slide in presentations I would give on what
BIP-119 could be with the support of a programming environment.</p>

<p>While my conceptions of what could be built with CTV were about on-par with
where they are today, the tools available were very clunky. You can see
one of the original diagrams from the C++ Code below (<a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/blob/8f297449ff296533d7dd0ac44b62cb3cc33d1b83/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L1339">code here</a>).</p>

<p>When I presented it on February 1st, 2020 at the CTV workshop, one of the last
Bitcoin events before the pandemic began<sup id="fnref:mit" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mit" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I knew I had to present a more
concrete vision on how smart contracts could be built, rather than spit-and-glue
C++.</p>

<p>And so I included slide inspired by the hand rolled smart contracts I was making
in C++ about how the technique could be generalized.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/bitcoin/advent/sapio-future/sapio-idea.svg" alt="" />
<em>a slide at the feb. 2020 CTV workshop.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a research project I am interested in pursuing. We have a few
scripting languages. We have Dan here who wrote Ivy. There’s also Balzac and
Solidity. It’s poorly named, but it actually has some really interesting ideas
that aren’t in other scripting languages for bitcoin. There’s some notion of
participants with private state they are storing, and has some notion of
interactivity. I also threw up there BlueSpec which is like a VHDL competitor
that is pretty neat. If you think about it, there’s a software layer for
controlling vaults but there’s also a hardware layer- so how can we describe
transactional hardware? You wind up with similar controls as a BlueSpec-like
language where you are creating plumbing and a description of how things are
moving rather than something that has imperative state.</p>

  <p>As an example, one of the properties with OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY that is cool is
the narrow window of a standard OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY script is that you have
this composability property where for a given model that goes to arbitrary
address outputs, you can just throw another one inside it. As the outputs of
that annuinity, you can put undo send as the outputs of that annunity, and you
can tag on more and more programs into that if you want. On this slide is a
templately description of a language, which helps if someone else given the same
program description can verify that the hash is the same for the given inputs.
Instead of sending you a million branches, you can generate them yourselves.</p>

  <p>Q: Is there code for your metascript thing?</p>

  <p>A: No. It’s just an idea I’ve been toying with. I got relatively close to
metascript just writing in C++ just writing with C++ templates. Then I got ready
to kill myself doing that because writing templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d discussed similar slides at earlier events, usually included it as an
example of something <em>someone else</em> could build while I kept pluggin’ away
working on Bitcoin Core. Eventually I realized that me claiming that CTV could
be used to do these things and CTV demonstrably doing these things was an
obstacle… I needed to make the prototype.</p>

<p>So I set off hacking together a prototype… I spent an afternoon or two mucking
around in C++ only to realize that wasn’t going to happen, and then I switched
to python. Python was a great choice, and after quite a bit of time pluggin
away, I had something that actually worked.</p>

<p>There was a moment of magic where I connected it to the Sapio Studio (which
actually existed long before Sapio as just a visualizer for a set of
transactions) to load a contract written in python and…  it worked. Really
well. It felt incredible. I began talking more about what Sapio could do,
thinking through some of the problems and solutions. I  even gave a talk in the
metaverse with Udi where I dropped my virtual laser pointer on the ground for a
minute and couldn’t pick it back up.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/bitcoin/advent/sapio-future/reckless.png" alt="" />
<em>there were more people sitting further back I swear…</em></p>

<p>At a certain point I decided to start working on cleaning up Sapio by using
Python’s gradual typing and trying to convert to using Miniscript instead of my
custom-made Sapio script fragment builder. I was neck deep in type refactors and
then I had a deep realization:</p>

<h2 id="python-fucking-sucks">Python FUCKING SUCKS</h2>

<p>I was incredibly greatful for the rapid iterating that python allowed me, but I
realized at this point that it was going to be nearly impossible to make Sapio
actually good and not just a toy working in python.  What had started as a proof
of concept for someone to do “for real” had gotten good enough conceptually but
was bursting at the seams and was not going to ever yield something production grade.</p>

<p>So I did a reset.</p>

<p>I started building Sapio in Rust, re-implementing (but much more cleanly) the
paradigms that I had previously developed, relying on well tested and type
rust-bitcoin libraries instead of janky test-framework python code from Bitcoin
Core.</p>

<p>And one day – almost like Deja Vu – I plugged the Sapio Rust served in place
of the Python one for the Sapio Studio and everything Just Worked™.</p>

<p>Since then, Sapio has only matured and gotten better and better with each
passing month.  I’ve added tons of new features, improved the underlying
architecture, made the ABIs more well defined, built stronger intergrations with
the GUI, and more. Today, Sapio is actually usable on mainnet (if you’re an
expert at least), and I’ve used to do congestion control payments and art
projects.</p>

<p>Sapio has helped me cut through the content for this Advent Calendar like a
swiss army knife.  It’s actually becoming a pretty decent tool!</p>

<h1 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h1>

<p>Sapio needs to get to the next level. There are many major areas of work in the
pipeline. You might think of this as “Sapio is so incomplete it’s not ready”.
I think of it more as Sapio is just getting started:</p>

<h4 id="upgrade-to-taproot">Upgrade to Taproot</h4>

<p>Support for Taproot in rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript is coming! Once that
lands, I need to rebase (and maybe upstream?) some Sapio features, and then
update the compiler to always use Taproot outputs!</p>

<h4 id="improve-sapio-ctv-emulators-with-taproot-if-ctv-seems-to-be-slow">Improve Sapio CTV Emulators with Taproot (if ctv seems to be slow)</h4>

<p>Once taproot lands, the multi-sig federated oracle designs can be set up to do a
MuSig Schnorr signature instead of just a bare multi-sig, allowing wider federations.</p>

<p>This engineering work only really matters if CTV seems unlikely, but could
be useful to have anyways for future purposes &amp; extensions to Sapio.</p>

<h4 id="build-out-some-full-featured-applications-backed-by-sapio">Build out some “full featured” applications backed by Sapio</h4>

<p>Right now Sapio works for making little Applets, but there is no “end to end”
software (e.g., vaults) made in Sapio.</p>

<p>This requires work on both the Sapio Studio front and potentially on a website
for things like Sapio NFTs.</p>

<p>This will push the boundaries on integrating Sapio into real applications.</p>

<p>One particular feature that would be great is ‘auto-signing’ on valid state
transitions proposed at a certain continuation point. For example, if we have an
NFT we want to dutch auction, we should be able to have a sapio module running
that is happy to spit out the relevant transactions with a nice API.</p>

<h4 id="more-advanced-programming-of-transactions">More advanced programming of transactions</h4>

<p>Currently the Sapio transaction builder from within Sapio branches is a bit
limited in what it can express.</p>

<p>Augmenting it with the ability to more fully describe partially signed bitcoin
transactions (PSBTs), e.g., when used in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continuation</code> context would
advance the state of the art.</p>

<h5 id="key-management">Key Management</h5>
<p>Relatedly, it would be really useful if you could tell Sapio how to access a
signing module and have sapio use that external key to generate the appropriate
signatures for the state transitions.</p>

<h4 id="better-sapio-cli--server-that-can-keep-wasm-modules-loaded-in-memory-aiding-performance">Better sapio-cli / server that can keep WASM modules loaded in memory, aiding performance</h4>

<p>Right now every time a module is used the entire thing has to reload which is
super slow.</p>

<p>It should be possible to have a single server instances that manages a cache of
all modules, greatly boosting performance, especially for recursive cross-module
calling contracts.</p>
<h4 id="client-side-verification-caching-across-module-boundaries">Client Side Verification Caching Across Module Boundaries</h4>

<p>For things like NFTs that we saw, we have to always re-compile the <em>entire</em>
history of the NFT to do state transitions. However, many of these state
transitions are just doing the exact same thing every time, re-verifying from
genesis. We should be able to cache the compilations at well defined boundaries.</p>

<h4 id="better-formal-analysis-tools--type-system-on-top-of-sapio">Better formal analysis tools / type system on top of Sapio</h4>
<p>Currently Sapio has the ability to define various interfaces for composing Sapio contracts cleanly.</p>

<p>But we don’t have a great way of proving what we want a contract to do v.s. what it does.</p>

<p>This work will start as being able to express more properties about a module in
it’s “manifest”, and will culminate in being able to check the validity of compositions
of contracts based on them.</p>

<p>If anyones looking to do a PhD thesis on Sapio, this is prolly it.</p>

<h4 id="more-module-types">More Module Types</h4>

<p>Right now all WASM modules are for generating a ‘Compiled’ contract from a JSON.</p>

<p>I would love to add defined module types to cover all the standard components like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Miniscript Fragments</li>
  <li>Then Functions</li>
  <li>Continuation Functions</li>
  <li>Transaction Template Generators</li>
  <li>Trait Verifiers</li>
</ul>

<p>and more.</p>

<h4 id="more-emulator-types">More Emulator Types</h4>

<p>Sapio works <em>today</em> with CTV <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">then</code> functions because the functionality can be
emulated by a federation of signers.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to cleanly extend the signing server paradigm to a number of
different types of Covenant proposal (e.g. APO, TLUV, CAT) or other opcodes
could add a lot of value for making Sapio the defacto platform and proving
ground for upgrades to Bitcoin.</p>

<h4 id="unifying-then-and-continuation">Unifying Then and Continuation</h4>

<p>Then and Continuation really are the same thing conceptually, it would be</p>

<h4 id="standard-library-of-useful-applications--plugins">Standard Library of useful applications / Plugins</h4>

<p>Title says it all. There should be more off the shelf things to use!</p>

<h4 id="wallet-stack-for-sapio-contracts">Wallet Stack for Sapio Contracts</h4>

<p>The Sapio Studio is rapidly imporving as a system for engaging with Sapio
contracts, but it’s lacking in the management and storage of all of a user’s
contracts. We can, and will, do a better job with this.</p>

<p>This includes being able to make watchtower-like functionality for Sapio. It’s
coming, but will likely require a lot of new features to the language spec to
express if this then that monitoring conditions. And with features comes
complexity.</p>

<p>You can see hints to this in the slide earlier, being able to react to e.g.
confirmation or mempool events.</p>

<p>This also includes dramatic improvements needed to the GUI so that users
can understand much more deeply what contracts are doing.</p>

<h4 id="binary-releases">Binary Releases</h4>

<p>Right now Sapio is just DIY to build and run it yourself, but we really ought to
work towards stable binary releases to quickstart users.</p>

<h4 id="visual-programming-for-building-sapio-contracts">Visual Programming for Building Sapio Contracts</h4>

<p>When composing together Sapio modules, I would <em>really</em> like for it to be kind
 of labview like interface for adding data or other modules, where you can
 “typecheck” that the wires (module names) are composing into slots they work.
 If that sounded like gibberish, I just mean that I want to be able to plug in a
 module hash for a NFT Sale contract into my NFT contract and have the UX give
 me real time feedback if I should be able to do that.</p>

<h4 id="sapio-package-manager--deterministic-builds--signers">Sapio Package Manager / Deterministic Builds / Signers</h4>

<p>As more modules become commonly used (e.g., like NFTs) we want to ensure all
 users can build an exact copy themselves (Deterministic Builds) or that they
 can find a build signed by a number of respected code signers (Signers). While
 we can use Cargo / crates.io for the package management of our actual rust code,
 we need something to distribute the sapio wasm blobs nicely!</p>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>

<p>Writing tests for Sapio contracts is hard as heck. We need some bold ideas on
 what sorts of properties would be useful to test for. Fortunately, a lot of
 properties we care about (like not wasting money) can be checked by the sapio
 library to be safe, but we still want to be able to ensure we never lose a
 users funds out of Sapio.</p>

<p>#### Getting CTV Locked in</p>

<p>Duh!</p>

<hr />

<p>If I get even a tenth of this completed 2022 will be a good year for Sapio.</p>

<p>But I plan to get it all done.</p>

<p>Perhaps with your support – if you’re an engineer or funder interested
 in helping propel this, please reach out!</p>

<p>p.s. safe holiday travels!</p>

        Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) Will Save Bitcoin
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Day 25: Rubin's Bitcoin Advent Calendar</h4>


    <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2021</span>

    <p><em>Welcome to day 25 of my Bitcoin Advent Calendar. You can see an index of all
the posts <a href="/advent21">here</a> or subscribe at
<a href="https://judica.org/join">judica.org/join</a> to get new posts in your inbox</em></p>

<p>The title of this article is a joke. Gotcha!</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/bitcoin/advent/dao/bart.png" alt="Bart Simpson writing &quot;DAOs are just fancy multisigs&quot;." /></p>

<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organization is pretty much what’s called an <em><a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003555.html">orphan
initialism</a></em>.
So while DAO doesn’t really mean anything is decentralized, autonomous, or an
organization, but the term DAO has stuck around anyways. Even moreso than NFT!
More or less, DAOs are just fancy multisigs. But they’ve been used for all sorts
of things, ranging from attempting to buy the US Constitution as a group,
investing in startups, buying Ross Ulbricht’s NFTs, or maybe even buying my
undies.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/bitcoin/advent/dao/nytimes.jpeg" alt="yes this is a joke" /></p>

<p>This post has some required reading. You have to have read through at least up
to <a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/10/advent-13/">payment pools</a> in the advent calendar, but
ideally you’d have read all the posts…</p>

<p>So how will fancy-multisigs save Bitcoin? In this post we’ll work through an
example of building a DAO to fund Bitcoin Core Developers, like a Bitcoin native
Gitcoin competitor.</p>
<hr />

<h1 id="what-do-we-want-from-our-dao">What do we want from our DAO:</h1>

<p>The DAO will serve three functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To Add members who pay in</li>
  <li>To make Payments if a Majority of the payers by value vote</li>
  <li>To mint commemorative NFTs</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="majority-rules">Majority rules</h2>

<p>DAOs are little democracies, and as such we need a voting scheme to do rule
changes whereby a threshold (e.g., 51%) decides what happens next. We have two
options, we can either count individuals as equal, or we can weight by amount of
funds contributed. We can do any threshold we like, it’s just “this many people
could steal the whole pot”.</p>

<p>For this post, we’ll do the weighted by funds contributed because that feels
closer to what’s happening in Ethereum land. Unfortunately a couple components
around generated arbitrary weighted signatures<sup id="fnref:frost" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:frost" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> just “aren’t quite there” or have
messy tradeoffs so we won’t consider those – yet. Instead we’ll just make a silly
limit: we will allow at most 24 participants<sup id="fnref:combo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:combo" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-a-dao">Implementing a DAO</h2>

<p>First let’s define the basics. A DAO should have Members who each are ID’d by a
key and have an amount of votes.</p>

<p>Now we can implement the main logic of the DAO. We want it to compute keys for
the majority to rule, and we want it to allow a majority to vote on a Proposal.
Note how when we make a payment, unlike in the Payment Pool, we decrease all
member’s proportional ownership in the pool<sup id="fnref:rat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rat" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, so that new owners are not
disadvantaged. But we could change that, to time-weight how long members have
been part of the DAO as well, or give people ‘special voting weight’
disconnected from money added. It’s really up to whatever you want…</p>

<p>We’ll implement the logic for each type of proposal (minting, adding, or paying).</p>

<p>Lastly, we need some super special sneaky algorithm fun to implement signing authorities
based on majority value. As noted, special uses of FROST could replace this, or future
research on better weighted key protocols.</p>

<p>For now, we limit ourselves to 25 keys so that compilation isn’t too slow. We can afford
having hundreds of thousands or millions of groups because of Taproot :).</p>

<p>All done! Not too bad huh? I think you’re really getting the hang of this thing!</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="using-a-dao">Using a DAO</h1>

<p>Now that we have this DAO we can get together a group of people and share a UTXO.</p>

<p>With that shared balance, we can get everyone in some kind of chat room and ‘govern’
what proposals folks want to vote on.</p>

<p>In particular, I would be very excited to see DAOs emerge for funding Bitcoin
Developers.  This type of structure can potentially help folks communally
allocate capital. Often times the biggest barrier is finding deals that make
sense, and DAOs would enable you to share with a group of friends and they could
make decisions for you.</p>

<p>It would even be possible to create DAOs on behalf of third parties and fund
them. For example, let’s say I get PKs for 10 devs I like and put a 10 BTC into
it and set the shares up so that there is a ‘leader’ with 30%, and the rest
split 70% of voting shares. The leader could just steal the money with another
21%, but would they? I hope not! Instead, they can vote on good things as
intended.  It’d also be possible for the DAO creator to embed an ‘oversight
comittee’ that can yank the funds if not being used.</p>

<p>Minting NFTs is kind of a cool feature since anyone can see they came from the
DAO if they track the DAO’s state updates (conceivably these get published for
auditing). NFTs could be issued as medals of honor for devs who follow their
grants. Or, if you really like NFTs, they could be used to issue software
licenses in exchange for contributing funds to the DAO operators.</p>

<h1 id="does-this-need-ctv">Does this need CTV?</h1>

<p>Nope. Just a fancy multisig, right?</p>

<p>Where CTV is useful is if we want to vote on proposals to put things into CTV
contracts, like subscriptions to developer grants, opening channels, etc.
Imagine the developer gets a contract where they get paid out every week, but
there is a auditing comittee that can be used to terminate the subscription and
return funds to the DAO if misbehavior is detected.</p>

<p>While you don’t need CTV in the DAO backbone, it would help open up new use
cases.</p>

<p>It would also be possible to add some ‘liveness’ smooth degradations of the DAO,
whereby half the majority (e.g., if majority is 50%, 25%) could vote that the
DAO is dead, and after a period of time for the majority recovery, distribute
the funds on a pre-comitted schedule.</p>

<p>We don’t show that here, but it wouldn’t be too hard now would it?</p>

<h1 id="generalizing">Generalizing</h1>

<p>One could go ahead and implement a DAO trait that all DAOs could share and build
a common UX for managing DAOs with a wide variety of custom logic…</p>

<p>It’d also be possible to have a DAO backbone which is a single UTXO, and have
other UTXOs ‘owned’ by the DAO that can get merged in later as a proposal. This
way contributions to the DAO don’t always require a state update from the DAO
itself.</p>

<p>For future work :)</p>

      <p>FROST allows n-M threshold Schnorr signatures, which can turn into a weighted solution by making M the total value and each party have W amount of keys for their contribution. But this scales poorly because you need to exchange keys and signatures linear in the Amount, which is up to a 51-bit number. <a href="#fnref:frost" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

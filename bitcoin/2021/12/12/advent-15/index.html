<h3 id="long-time-no-see-you-come-around-these-parts-often">Long time no see. You come around these parts often?</h3>

<p>Let’s talk mining pools.</p>

<p>First, let’s define some things. What is a pool? A pool is a way to take a
strongly discontinuous income stream and turn it into a smoother income stream.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you are a songwriter. You’re a dime a dozen, there are 1000
songwriters. If you get song of the year, you get $1M Bonus. However, all the
other songwriters are equally pretty good, it’s a crapshoot. So you and half the
other songwriters agree to split the prize money whoever wins. Now, on average,
every other year you get $2000, instead of once every thousand years. Since
you’re only going to work about 50 years, your “expected” amount of winnings
would be $50,000 if you worked alone. But expected winnings don’t buy bread. By
pooling, your expected winnings are $2000 every other year for 50 years, so also
$50,000. But you expect to actually have some spare cash laying around. However,
if you got lucky and won the contest the year you wrote a hit, you’d end up way
richer! but the odds are 1:20 of that ever happening in your life, so there
aren’t that many rich songwriters (50 out of your 1000 peers…).</p>

<p>Mining is basically the same as our songwriter contest, just instead of silver
tongued lyrics, it’s noisy whirring bitcoin mining rigs. Many machines will
never mine a block. Many miners (the people operating it) won’t either! However,
by pooling their efforts together, they can turn a once-in-a-million-years
chance into earning temperatureless immaterial bitcoin day in and day out.</p>

<h2 id="who-pissed-in-your-pool">Who Pissed In your Pool?</h2>

<p>The problem with pooling is that they take an extremely decentralized process
and add a centralized coordination layer on top. This layer has numerous issues
including but not limited to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Weak Infrastructure: What happens if e.g. DNS goes down as it did recently?</li>
  <li>KYC/AML requirements to split the rewards</li>
  <li>Centralized “block policies”</li>
  <li>Bloating chain space with miner payouts</li>
  <li>Getting kicked out of their home country (happened in China recently)</li>
  <li>Custodial hacking risk.</li>
</ol>

<p>People are working on a lot of these issues with upgrades like “Stratum V2”
which aspire to give the pools less authority.</p>

<p>In theory, mining pool operators should be against things that limit their
business operations. However, we’re in a bit “later stage bitcoin mining”
whereas pooling is seen more as a necessary evil, and most pools are anchored by
big mining operations. And getting rid of pools would be great for Bitcoin,
which would increase the value of folks holdings/mining rigs. So while it might
seem irrational, it’s actually perfectly incentive compatible that mining pools
operators consider mining pools to be something to make less of a centralization
risk. Even if pools don’t exist in their current form, mining service providers
can still make really good business offerring all kinds of support.  Forgive me
if i’m speaking out of turn, pool ops!</p>

<h2 id="making-mining-pools-better">Making Mining Pools Better</h2>

<p>To make mining pools better, we can set some ambitious goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Funds should not be centrally custodied, ever, if at all.</li>
  <li>No KYC/AML.</li>
  <li>No “Extra network” software required.</li>
  <li>No blockchain bloat.</li>
  <li>No extra infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The size of a viable pool should be smaller. Remember our singer – if you
just pool with one other songwriter it doesn’t make your expected time till
payout in your lifetime. So bigger the pools, more regular the payouts. We want
the smallest possible “units of control” with the most regular payouts possible.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="fuck--thats-a-huge-list-of-goals">Fuck.  That’s a huge list of goals.</h1>

<p>But if you work with me here, you’ll see how we can nail every last one of them.
And in doing so, we can clear up some major Privacy hurdles and Decentralization
issues.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="building-the-decentralized-coordination-free-mining-pool">Building the Decentralized Coordination Free Mining Pool</h1>
<p>We’ll build this up step by step. We probably won’t look at any Sapio code
today, but as a precursor I really must insist read the last couple posts first:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/09/advent-12/">Congestion Control</a></li>
  <li><a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/10/advent-13/">Payment Pools</a></li>
  <li><a href="/bitcoin/2021/12/11/advent-14/">Channels</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You read them, right?</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Ok.</p>

<p>The idea is actually really simple, but we’ll build it up piece by piece by piece.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-window-functions-over-blocks">Part 1: Window Functions over Blocks.</h2>

<p>A window function is a little program that operates over the last “N” things and
computes something.</p>

<p>E.g., a window function could operate over the last 5 hours and count how many
carrots you ate. Or over the last 10 cars that pass you on the road.</p>

<p>A window function of bitcoin blocks could operate over a number of different things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The last 144 blocks</li>
  <li>The last 24 hours of blocks</li>
  <li>The last 100 blocks that meet some filter function (e.g, of size &gt; 500KB)</li>
</ul>

<p>A window function could compute lot of different things too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The average time difference between blocks</li>
  <li>The amount of fees paid in those blocks</li>
  <li>A subset of the blocks that pass another filter.</li>
</ul>

<p>A last note: window functions need, for something like Bitcoin, a start height
where we exclude things prior (e.g., last 100 blocks since block 500,000)</p>

<h2 id="part-2-giving-presents-to-all-our-friends">Part 2: Giving presents to all our friends</h2>

<p>Let’s do a window function over the last 100 Blocks and collect the 1st address
in the output of the coinbase transaction.</p>

<p>Now, in our block, instead of paying ourselves a reward, let’s divvy it up among
the last 100 blocks and pay them out our entire block reward, split up.</p>

<p>We’re so nice!</p>

<h2 id="part-3-giving-presents-to-our-nice-friends-only">Part 3: Giving presents to our nice friends only</h2>

<p>What if instead of paying everyone, we do a window function over the last 100
blocks and filter for only blocks that followed the same rule that we are
following (being nice). We take the addresses of each of them, and divvy up our
award to them too like before.</p>

<p>We’re so nice to only our nice friends!</p>

<p>Now stop and think a minute. All the “nice” blocks in the last 100 didn’t get a
reward directly, but they got paid by the future nice blocks handsomely.  Even
though we don’t get any money from the block we mined, if our nice friends keep
on mining then they’ll pay us too returning the favor.</p>

<p>Re-read the above till it makes sense. This is the big idea. Now onto the “small”
ideas.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-deferring-payouts">Part 4: Deferring Payouts</h2>

<p>This is all kinda nice, but now our blocks get really really big since we’re
paying all our friends. Maybe we can be nice, but a little mean too and tell
them to use their own block space to get their gift.</p>

<p>So instead of paying them out directly, we round up all the nice block addresses
like before and we toss it in a Congestion Control Tree.</p>

<p>Now our friends do likewise too. Since the Congestion Control Module is
deterministic, everyone can generate the same tree and both verify that our
payout was received and generate the right transaction.</p>

<p>Now this gift doesn’t take up any of our space!</p>

<h2 id="part-5-compacting">Part 5: Compacting</h2>

<p>But it still takes up space for someone, and that blows.</p>

<p>So let’s do our pals a favor. Instead of just peeping the 1st address (which
really could be anything) in the coinbase transaction, let’s use a good ole
fashioned OP_RETURN (just some extra metadata) with a Taproot Public Key we want
to use in it.</p>

<p>Now let’s collect all the blocks that again follow the rule defined here, and
take all their taproot keys.</p>

<p>Now we gift them into a Payment Pool, instead of into just a Congestion Control
tree with musig aggregated keys at every node.  It’s a minor difference – a
Congestion Control tree doesn’t have a taproot key path – but that difference
means the world.</p>

<p>Now instead of having to expand to get everyone paid, they can use it like a
Payment Pool!  And Pools from different runs can even do a many-to-one
transaction where they merge balances.</p>

<p>For example, imagine two pools:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>UTXO A from Block N: 1BTC Alice, 1BTC Carol, 1BTC Dave
UTXO B Block N+1: 1BTC Alice, 1BTC Carol, 1BTC Bob
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can do a transaction as follows to merge the balances:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Spends:
    UTXO A, B
Creates:
    UTXO C: 2BTC Alice, 2BTC Carol, 1BTC Dave, 1BTC Bob
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Compared to doing the payments directly, fully expanding this creates only 4
outputs instead of 6! It gets even better the more miners are involved.</p>

<p>We could even merge many pools at the same time, and in the future, benefit from
something like cross-input-signature aggregation to make it even cheaper and
create even fewer outputs.</p>

<h2 id="part-6-channels">Part 6: Channels</h2>

<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>

<p>We can even make the terminal leafs of the Payment Pool be channels instead of direct UTXOs.</p>

<p>This has a few big benefits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We don’t need to do any compaction as urgently, we can immediately route funds around.</li>
  <li>We don’t need to necessarily wait 100 blocks to spend out of our coinbase since we can use the channel directly.</li>
  <li>Instead of compaction, we can just “swap” payments around across channels.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/public/img/bitcoin/advent/dcfmp/aggpayments.svg" alt="channel balancing" />
<em>How channel balancing might look.</em></p>

<p>This should be opt-in (with a tag field to opt-in/out)  since if you didn’t want
a channel it could be annoying to have the extra timeout delays, especially if you
wanted e.g. to deposit directly to cold storage.</p>

<h2 id="part-7-selecting-window-functions">Part 7: Selecting Window Functions</h2>

<p>What’s the best window function?</p>

<p>I got no freakin’ clue. We can window over time, blocks, fee amounts,
participating blocks, non participating blocks, etc.</p>

<p>Picking a good window function is an exercise in itself, and needs to be
scrutinized for game theoretic attacks.</p>

<h2 id="part-8-payout-functions">Part 8: Payout Functions</h2>

<p>Earlier we showed the rewards as being just evenly split among the last blocks,
but we could also reward people differently. E.g., we could reward miners who
divided more reward to the other miners more (incentivize collecting more fees),
or really anything deterministic that we can come up with.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t know the answer here. It’s a big design space!</p>

<h2 id="part-9-voting-on-parameters">Part 9: Voting on Parameters</h2>

<p>One last idea: if we had some sort of parameter space for the window functions,
we could perhaps vote on-chain for tweaking it. E.g., each miner could vote to
+1 or -1 from the window length.</p>

<p>I don’t particularly think this is a good idea, because it brings in all sorts
of weird attacks and incentives, but it is a cool case of on-chain governance so
worth thinking more on.</p>

<h2 id="part-10-end-of-transmission">Part 10: End of Transmission?</h2>

<p>No more steps. Now we think a bit more about the implications of this.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="solo-mining">Solo mining?</h2>

<p>Well the bad news about this design is that we can’t really do solo mining.
Remember, most miners probably will never mine a block. So they would never be
able to enter the pool.</p>

<p>We could mess around with including things like partial work shares (just a
few!) into blocks, but I think the best bet is to instead to focus on
micro-pools. Micro-pools would be small units of hashrate (say, 1%?) that are
composed of lots of tiny miners.</p>

<p>The tiny miners can all connect to each other and gossip around their work
shares, use some sort of conesnsus algorithm, or use a pool operator. The blocks
that they mine should use a taproot address/key which is a multisig of some
portion of the workshares, that gets included in the top-level pool as a part of
Payment Pool.</p>

<p>So while we don’t quite make solo mining feasible, the larger the window we use
the tinier the miners can be while getting better de-risking.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis?</h2>

<p>A little out of scope for here, but it should work conceptually!</p>

<p>A while back I analyzed this kind of setup, <a href="https://utxos.org/uses/miningpools/">read more
here</a>. Feel free to experiment
with window and payout functions and report back!</p>

<em>chart showing that the rewards are smoother over time</em></p>

<h2 id="now-implement-it">Now Implement it!</h2>

<p>Well we are <em>not</em> gonna do that here, since this is kinda a mangum opus of Sapio
and it would be wayyyy too long. But it should be somewhat conceptually
straightforward if you paid close attention to the “precursor” posts. And you
can see some seeds of progress for an implementation on
<a href="https://github.com/sapio-lang/sapio/blob/master/examples/dcf_mining_pool/src/main.rs">github</a>,
although I’ve mostly been focused on simpler applications (e.g. the constituent
components of payment pools and channels) for the time being… contributions welcome!</p>

<hr />

<p>TL;DR: Sapio + CTV makes pooled mining more decentralized and more private.</p>

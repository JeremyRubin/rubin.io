A "Vault" is a general concept for a way of protecting Bitcoin from theft
through a cold-storage smart contract. While there is not formal definition of
what is and is not a Vault, generally a Vault has more structure around a
withdrawal than just a multisig.

One of the earlier
[references](https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/02/26/how-to-implement-secure-bitcoin-vaults/)
for Vaults was a design whereby every time you request to withdraw from it you
can "reset" the request within a time limit.  This means that while an attacker
might steal your keys, you can "fight" to make it a negative sum game -- e.g.,
they'll just keep on paying fees to eventually steal an amount less than they
paid. This might serve to disincentivize hacking exchanges if hackers are less
likely to actually get coins.

Similar Vaults can be built using Sapio, but the logic for them involves
unrolling the contract a predefined number of steps. This isn't bad because if
the period of timeout is 1 week then just unrolling 5,200 times gets you one
thousand years of hacking disincentive.

The contract for that might look something like this in Sapio (_note: I was
running behind on this post so I may make modifications to make these examples
better later_):

```rust
struct VaultOne {
    /// Key that will authorize:
    /// 1) Recursing with the vault
    /// 2) Spending from the vault after not moved for a period
    key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    /// How long should the vault live for
    steps: u32,
}

impl VaultOne {
    /// Checks if steps are remaining
    #[compile_if]
    fn not_out_of_steps(self, ctx: Context) {
        if self.steps == 0 {
            ConditionalCompileType::Never
        } else {
            ConditionalCompileType::NoConstraint
        }
    }

    #[guard]
    fn authorize(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.key.clone())
    }

    /// Recurses the vault if authorized
    #[then(compile_if = "[Self::not_out_of_steps]", guarded_by = "[Self::authorize]")]
    fn step(self, ctx: Context) {
        let next = VaultOne {
            key: self.key.clone(),
            steps: self.steps - 1,
        };
        let amt = ctx.funds();
        ctx.template()
            .add_output(amt, &next, None)?
            // For Paying fees via CPFP. Note that we should totally definitely
            // get rid of the dust limit for contracts like this, or enable
            // IUTXOS with 0 Value
            .add_output(Amount::from_sat(0), &self.key, None)?
            .into()
    }
    /// Allow spending after a week long delay
    #[guard]
    fn finish(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::And(vec![
            Clause::Key(self.key.clone()),
            RelTime::try_from(Duration::from_secs(7 * 24 * 60 * 60))
                .unwrap()
                .into(),
        ])
    }
}
/// Binds the logic to the Contract
impl Contract for VaultOne {
    declare! {then, Self::step}
    declare! {finish, Self::finish}
}
```

But we can also build much more sophisticated Vaults that do more. Suppose we
want to have a vault where once a week you can claim a trickle of bitcoin into a
hot wallet, or you can send it back to a cold storage key. This is a "structured
liquidity vault" that gives you time-release Bitcoin. Let's check out some code
and talk about it more:



```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct VaultTwo {
    /// Key just for authorizing steps
    authorize_key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    amount_per_step: bitcoin::Amount,
    /// Hot wallet key
    hot_key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    /// Cold wallet key
    cold_key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    steps: u32,
}

impl VaultTwo {
    #[compile_if]
    fn not_out_of_steps(self, ctx: Context) {
        if self.steps == 0 {
            ConditionalCompileType::Never
        } else {
            ConditionalCompileType::NoConstraint
        }
    }

    #[guard]
    fn authorized(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.authorize_key.clone())
    }
    #[then(compile_if = "[Self::not_out_of_steps]", guarded_by = "[Self::authorized]")]
    fn step(self, ctx: Context) {
        // Creates a recursive vault with one fewer steps
        let next = VaultTwo {
            steps: self.steps - 1,
            ..self.clone()
        };
        let amt = ctx.funds();
        ctx.template()
            // send to the new vault
            .add_output(amt - self.amount_per_step, &next, None)?
            // withdraw some to hot storage
            .add_output(self.amount_per_step, &self.hot_key, None)?
            // For Paying fees via CPFP. Note that we should totally definitely
            // get rid of the dust limit for contracts like this, or enable
            // IUTXOS with 0 Value
            .add_output(Amount::from_sat(0), &self.authorize_key, None)?
            // restrict that we have to wait a week
            .set_sequence(
                -1,
                RelTime::try_from(Duration::from_secs(7 * 24 * 60 * 60))?.into(),
            )?
            .into()
    }
    /// allow sending the remaining funds into cold storage
    #[then(compile_if = "[Self::not_out_of_steps]", guarded_by = "[Self::authorized]")]
    fn terminate(self, ctx: Context) {
        ctx.template()
            // send the remaining funds to cold storage
            .add_output(self.amount_per_step*self.steps, &self.cold_key, None)?
            // For Paying fees via CPFP. Note that we should totally definitely
            // get rid of the dust limit for contracts like this, or enable
            // IUTXOS with 0 Value
            .add_output(Amount::from_sat(0), &self.authorize_key, None)?
            .into()
    }
}

impl Contract for VaultTwo {
    declare! {then, Self::step, Self::terminate}
}
```


This type of Vault is particularly interesting for e.g., withdrawing from an
exchange business.  Imagine a user, Elsa who wants to have a great cold storage
system. So Elsa sets up a xpub key and puts it on ice. She then generates a new
address, and requests that the exchange let the funds go to it. Later that
month, Elsa wants to buy a coffee with her Bitcoin so she has to thaw out her
cold storage to spend (maybe using a offline PSBT signing), and transfer the
funds to her destination or to a hot wallet if she wants a bit of extra pocket
money. Instead suppose Elsa sets up a timerelease vault. Then, she can set up
her cold vault and automatically be able to claim 1 Bitcoin a month out of it,
or if she notices some coins missing from her hot wallet redirect the funds
solely under her ice castle.

This has many benefits for an average user. One is that you can invest in your
cold storage of keys *once* in your life and only have to access it in
unexpected circumstance. This means that: users might elect to use something
more secure/inconvenient to access (e.g. strongly geo-sharded); that they won't
reveal access patterns by visiting their key storage facility; and that they
don't need to expose themselves to recurring fat-finger[^fat] risk.

[^fat]: Sending the wrong amount because you click the wrong key with your too-large hands.


## Getting a little more advanced

What are some other things we might want to do in a vault?  Let's do a quickfire
-- we won't code these here, but you'll see examples of these techniques in
posts to come:

### Send a percentage, not a fixed amount

Let the contract know the intended amount, and then compute the withdrawals as
percentages in the program.

### Non-Key Destinations
In the examples above, we use keys for hot wallet, cold wallet, and authorizations.

However, we could very well use other programs! For example, imagine a
time-release vault that goes into a anti-theft locker.

### Change Hot Wallet Every Step

This one is pretty simple -- if you have N steps just provide a list of N
different destinations and use the i-th one as you go!


### Topping up:

There are advanced techniques that can be used to allow depositing *into* a
vault after it has been created (i.e., topping up), but that's too advanced to
go into detail today. For those inclined, a small hint: make the "top up" vault
consume an output from the previous vault, CTV commits to the script so you can
use a salted P2SH out.



## Even more advanced

What if we want to ensure that after a withdraw funds are re-inserted into the Vault?


We'll ditch the recursion (for now), and just look at some basic logic. Imagine
a coin is held by a cold storage key, and we want to use Sapio to generate a transaction
that withdraws funds to an address and sends the rest back into cold storage. 

```rust
struct VaultThree {
    key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
}

/// Special struct for passing arguments to a created contract
enum Withdrawal {
    Send {
        addr: bitcoin::Address,
        amount: bitcoin::Amount,
        fees: bitcoin::Amount,
    },
    Nothing,
}
/// required...
impl Default for Withdrawal {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Withdrawal::Nothing
    }
}
impl StatefulArgumentsTrait for Withdrawal {}

/// helper for rust type system issue
fn default_coerce(
    k: <VaultThree as Contract>::StatefulArguments,
) -> Result<Withdrawal, CompilationError> {
    Ok(k)
}

impl VaultThree {
    #[guard]
    fn signed(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.key.clone())
    }
    #[continuation(guarded_by = "[Self::signed]", coerce_args = "default_coerce")]
    fn withdraw(self, ctx: Context, request: Withdrawal) {
        if let Withdrawal::Send { amount, fees, addr } = request {
            let amt = ctx.funds();
            ctx.template()
                // send the rest recursively to this contract
                .add_output(amt - amount - fees, self, None)?
                // process the withdrawal
                .add_output(amount, &Compiled::from_address(addr, None), None)?
                // mark fees as spent
                .spend_amount(fees)?
                .into()
        } else {
            empty()
        }
    }
}
impl Contract for VaultThree {
    declare! {updatable<Withdrawal>, Self::withdraw}
}
```
Now we've seen how updatable continuation clauses can be used to dynamically
pass arguments to a Sapio contract and let the module figure out what the next
transactions should be, managing recursive and non-enumerated state transitions
(albeit with a trust model).


<hr>

That's probably enough for today, before I make your head explode. We'll see more examples soon!

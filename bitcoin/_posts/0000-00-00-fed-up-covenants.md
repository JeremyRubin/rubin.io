title: FE'd Up Covenants
date: 2024-05-29
---
Covenants are a way of expressing restrictions on Bitcoin. Covenants, while
possible to implement as an extension to Bitcoin, do not exist natively. To
enable them requires the Bitcoin community to agree upon upgrades such as CTV,
CAT, CSFS, and more.  This paper serves to demonstrate at a high level how
covenants could be introduced to Bitcoin without a soft fork using Functional
Encryption and Zero Knowledge Proofs.

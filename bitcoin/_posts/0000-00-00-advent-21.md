Today's a bit of a cheat day for me -- not really "new" content, but mostly
stuff re-packaged[^pun] from [learn.sapio-lang.org](https://learn.sapio-lang.org).

But it belongs in the series, and is it really plagarism if I wrote it myself?

[^pun]: pun certainly intended.

<hr>
So you've written a Sapio contract and you're ready to get it out into the
world.

How should you release it? How should you use it?

Today's post covers various ways to deploy and use Sapio contracts.

#### Note on Open Sourcing:
> In general, it is important to make the code available in an open source way,

> in the future we may build a Sapio specific package manager as smart contracts
> have some unique differences.



# Packaging Contracts via WASM 

WASM is "WebAssembly", or a standard for producing bytecode objects that can
be run on any platform. As the name suggests, it was originally designed for
use in web browsers as a compiler target for any language to produce code to
run safely from untrusted sources.

So what's it doing in Sapio?

WASM is designed to be cross platform and deterministic, which makes it a great
target for smart contracts that we want to be able to be reproduced locally. The
determinism also enables our update system. It also makes it *relatively* safe
to run smart contracts provided by untrusted parties as the security of the WASM
sandbox prevents bad code from harming or infecting our system.

Sapio Contract objects can be built into  WASM binaries very easily. The code required is basically:

```rust
/// MyContract must support Deserialize and JsonSchema
#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct MyContract;
impl Contract for MyContract{\*...*\};
/// binds to the plugin interface -- only one REGISTER macro permitted per project
REGISTER![MyContract];
```

See [the example](https://github.com/sapio-lang/sapio/tree/master/plugin-example) for more details.
The best way to make a new plugin is just to copy that directory and update the `Cargo.toml` with a new name.

These compiled objects require a special environment to be interacted with.
That environment is provided by the Sapio CLI as a standalone binary. It is also
possible to use the interface provided by the `sapio-wasm-plugin` crate to load
a plugin from any rust codebase programmatically. Lastly, one could create
similar bindings for another platform as long as a WASM interpreter is
available.


## Cross Module Calls (CMC)

The WASM Plugin Handle architecture permits one WASM plugin to call into
another. This is incredibly powerful. What this enables one to do is to
package Sapio contracts that are generic and can call one another either by
hash (with effective subresource integrity) or by a nickname (providing easy
user customizability).

For example, suppose I was writing a standard contract component `C` which I
publish. Then later, I develop a contract `B` which is designed to work with
`C`. Rather than having to depend on `C`'s source code (which I may not want to
do for various reasons -- for example `C` could be a standard), I could simply
hard code `C`'s hash into `B` and call `create_contract_by_key(key: &[u8; 32],
args: Value, amt: Amount)` to get the desired code. The plugin management system
automatically searches for a contract plugin with that hash, and tries to call
it with the provided JSON arguments. Using `create_contract(key:&str,
args:Value: amt:Amount)`, a nickname can be provided in which case the
appropriate plugin is resolved by the environment. Lastly, it's possible to use
`lookup_this_module_name()` to resolve the currently executing modules hash for
recursive calls. Recursive CMC calls can be helpful when you want to either
make a contract generic, or you want a clean JSON argument interface between 
units. It's also possible for a contract to detect if a generic argument 
would result in a recursive CMC and cut-through it locally.


```rust
struct C;
const DEPENDS_ON_MODULE : [u8; 32] = [0;32];
impl Contract for C {
    #[then]
    fn demo(self, ctx: Context) {
        let amt = ctx.funds()/2;
        ctx.template()
            .add_output(amt, &create_contract("users_cold_storage", /**/, amt), None)?
            .add_output(amt, &create_contract_by_key(&DEPENDS_ON_MODULE, /**/, amt), None)?
            .add_output(amt, &create_contract_by_key(&lookup_this_module_name().unwrap(), /**/, amt), None)?
            .into()
    }
}
```
### Typed Calls
 Using JSONSchemas, plugins have a basic type system that enables run-time
 checking for compatibility. Plugins can guarantee they implement particular
 interfaces faithfully. These interfaces currently only support protecting the
 call, but make no assurances about the returned value or potential errors from
 the callee's implementation of the trait.

For example, suppose I want to be able to specify a provided module must
statisfy a calling convention for batching. I define the trait
`BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1` as follows:

```rust
/// A payment to a specific address
#[derive(JsonSchema, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Payment {
    /// The amount to send in sats
    pub amount: AmountU64,
    /// # Address
    /// The Address to send to
    pub address: Address,
}
#[derive(Serialize, JsonSchema, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1 {
    pub payments: Vec<Payment>,
    pub feerate_per_byte: AmountU64,
}
```

I can then turn this into a SapioJSONTrait by implementing the trait and
providing an "example" function.
```rust
impl SapioJSONTrait for BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1 {
    /// required to implement
    fn get_example_for_api_checking() -> Value {
        #[derive(Serialize)]
        enum Versions {
            BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1),
        }
        serde_json::to_value(Versions::BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(
            BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1 {
                payments: vec![],
                feerate_per_byte: Amount::from_sat(0).into(),
            },
        ))
        .unwrap()
    }

    /// optionally, this method may be overridden directly for more advanced type checking.
    fn check_trait_implemented(api: &dyn SapioAPIHandle) -> bool {
        Self::check_trait_implemented_inner(api).is_ok()
    }
}
```
If a contract module can receive the example, then it is considered to have
implemented the API. We can implement the receivers for a module as follows:

```rust
struct MockContract;
/// # Different Calling Conventions to create a Treepay
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
enum Versions {
    /// # Base
    Base(MockContract),
    /// # Batching Trait API
    BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1),
}
impl From<BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1> for MockContract {
    fn from(args: BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1) -> Self {
        MockContract
    }
}
impl From<Versions> for TreePay {
    fn from(v: Versions) -> TreePay {
        match v {
            Versions::Base(v) => v,
            Versions::BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(v) => v.into(),
        }
    }
}
REGISTER![[MockContract, Versions], "logo.png"];
```

Now `MockContract` can be called via the `BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1` trait
interface.

Another module in the future need only have a field
`SapioHostAPI<BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1>`. This type verifies at deserialize
time that the provided name or hash key implements the required interface(s).

### Future Work on Cross Module Calls



- **Gitian Packaging:** Using a gitian signed packaging distribution system
would enable a user to set up a web-of-trust setting for their sapio compiler
and enable fetching of sub-resources by hash if they've been signed by the
appropriate parties.
- **NameSpace Registration:** A system to allow people to register names
unambiguously would aid in ensuring no conflicts. For now, we can handle
this using a centralized repo.
- **Remote CMC:** In some cases, we may want to make a call to a remote
server that will call a given module for us. This might be desirable if the
server holds sensitive material that we shouldn't have.
- **Polymorphic CMC:** currently, CMC's only return the `Compiled` type. Perhaps
future `CMC` support can return arbitrary types, allowing other types of
functionality to be packaged. For example, it would be great if a `guard` clause
could be generated just from a separate WASM module.


# What if I don't *want* WASM?

Well, ngmi. JK. Kinda.

You *do* really want WASM. You very much want your contracts to be
deterministically compiled.  If they are not, then a lot of things are not
guaranteed to work correctly and you might lose funds.

We're very focused on run-in WASM and not focused on other things.

That said, Sapio is just a Rust library, so you can embed your contracts
into an application directly, e.g., for an embedded signing device.

If you do this it is paramount that you carefully audit and check that you are
able to get consistent deterministic results out, or that you do not need to be
able to deterministically recompile (this is true in many cases!) and can save
the compilation result.

Another technique you can use is to build a bigger application around a contract
and then compile *that* to a WASM blob. Also works fine if you're careful not
to accidentally add some entropy.

<hr>

That's all folks. In sum: Sapio is using WASM, you can choose to not use it at
your own peril.

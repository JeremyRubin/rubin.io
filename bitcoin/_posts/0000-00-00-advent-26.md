_Welcome to day 26 of my Bitcoin Advent Calendar. You can see the previous post

Sapio began as little more than a slide in presentations I would give on what
BIP-119 could be with the support of a programming environment.

While my conceptions of what could be built with CTV were about on-par with
where they are today, the tools available were very clunky. You can see
one of the original diagrams from the C++ Code below ([code here](https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/blob/8f297449ff296533d7dd0ac44b62cb3cc33d1b83/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L1339)).

When I presented it on February 1st, 2020 at the CTV workshop, one of the last
Bitcoin events before the pandemic began[^mit], I knew I had to present a more
concrete vision on how smart contracts could be built, rather than spit-and-glue
C++.

[^mit]: That honor I think goes to the MIT Bitcoin Expo.

And so I included slide inspired by the hand rolled smart contracts I was making
in C++ about how the technique could be generalized.

I'd discussed similar slides at earlier events, usually included it as an
example of something _someone else_ could build while I kept pluggin' away
working on Bitcoin Core. Eventually I realized that me claiming that CTV could
be used to do these things and CTV demonstrably doing these things was an
obstacle... I needed to make the prototype.

So I set off hacking together a prototype... I spent an afternoon or two mucking
around in C++ only to realize that wasn't going to happen, and then I switched
to python. Python was a great choice, and after quite a bit of time pluggin
away, I had something that actually worked.

There was a moment of magic where I connected it to the Sapio Studio (which
actually existed long before Sapio as just a visualizer for a set of
transactions) to load a contract written in python and...  it worked. Really
well. It felt incredible. I began talking more about what Sapio could do,
thinking through some of the problems and solutions. I  even gave a talk in the
metaverse with Udi where I dropped my virtual laser pointer on the ground for a
minute and couldn't pick it back up.

![](/public/img/bitcoin/advent/sapio-future/reckless.png)
_there were more people sitting further back I swear..._

At a certain point I decided to start working on cleaning up Sapio by using
Python's gradual typing and trying to convert to using Miniscript instead of my
custom-made Sapio script fragment builder. I was neck deep in type refactors and
then I had a deep realization:

## Python FUCKING SUCKS

I was incredibly greatful for the rapid iterating that python allowed me, but I
realized at this point that it was going to be nearly impossible to make Sapio
actually good and not just a toy working in python.  What had started as a proof
of concept for someone to do "for real" had gotten good enough conceptually but
was bursting at the seams and was not going to ever yield something production grade.

So I did a reset.

I started building Sapio in Rust, re-implementing (but much more cleanly) the
paradigms that I had previously developed, relying on well tested and type
rust-bitcoin libraries instead of janky test-framework python code from Bitcoin
Core.

And one day -- almost like Deja Vu -- I plugged the Sapio Rust served in place
of the Python one for the Sapio Studio and everything Just Worked™.

Since then, Sapio has only matured and gotten better and better with each
passing month.  I've added tons of new features, improved the underlying
architecture, made the ABIs more well defined, built stronger intergrations with
the GUI, and more. Today, Sapio is actually usable on mainnet (if you're an
expert at least), and I've used to do congestion control payments and art
projects.

Sapio has helped me cut through the content for this Advent Calendar like a
swiss army knife.  It's actually becoming a pretty decent tool!

# What's Next

Sapio needs to get to the next level. There are many major areas of work in the
pipeline. You might think of this as "Sapio is so incomplete it's not ready".
I think of it more as Sapio is just getting started:


#### Upgrade to Taproot

Support for Taproot in rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript is coming! Once that
lands, I need to rebase (and maybe upstream?) some Sapio features, and then
update the compiler to always use Taproot outputs!

#### Improve Sapio CTV Emulators with Taproot (if ctv seems to be slow)

Once taproot lands, the multi-sig federated oracle designs can be set up to do a
MuSig Schnorr signature instead of just a bare multi-sig, allowing wider federations.

This engineering work only really matters if CTV seems unlikely, but could
be useful to have anyways for future purposes & extensions to Sapio.

#### Build out some "full featured" applications backed by Sapio

Right now Sapio works for making little Applets, but there is no "end to end"
software (e.g., vaults) made in Sapio.

This requires work on both the Sapio Studio front and potentially on a website
for things like Sapio NFTs.

This will push the boundaries on integrating Sapio into real applications.

One particular feature that would be great is 'auto-signing' on valid state
transitions proposed at a certain continuation point. For example, if we have an
NFT we want to dutch auction, we should be able to have a sapio module running
that is happy to spit out the relevant transactions with a nice API.

#### More advanced programming of transactions 

Currently the Sapio transaction builder from within Sapio branches is a bit
limited in what it can express.

Augmenting it with the ability to more fully describe partially signed bitcoin
transactions (PSBTs), e.g., when used in the `continuation` context would
advance the state of the art.

##### Key Management
Relatedly, it would be really useful if you could tell Sapio how to access a
signing module and have sapio use that external key to generate the appropriate
signatures for the state transitions.

#### Better sapio-cli / server that can keep WASM modules loaded in memory, aiding performance

Right now every time a module is used the entire thing has to reload which is
super slow.

It should be possible to have a single server instances that manages a cache of
all modules, greatly boosting performance, especially for recursive cross-module
calling contracts.
#### Client Side Verification Caching Across Module Boundaries

For things like NFTs that we saw, we have to always re-compile the *entire*
history of the NFT to do state transitions. However, many of these state
transitions are just doing the exact same thing every time, re-verifying from
genesis. We should be able to cache the compilations at well defined boundaries.

#### Better formal analysis tools / type system on top of Sapio
Currently Sapio has the ability to define various interfaces for composing Sapio contracts cleanly.

But we don't have a great way of proving what we want a contract to do v.s. what it does.

This work will start as being able to express more properties about a module in
it's "manifest", and will culminate in being able to check the validity of compositions
of contracts based on them.

If anyones looking to do a PhD thesis on Sapio, this is prolly it.


#### More Module Types

Right now all WASM modules are for generating a 'Compiled' contract from a JSON.

I would love to add defined module types to cover all the standard components like:

- Miniscript Fragments
- Then Functions
- Continuation Functions
- Transaction Template Generators
- Trait Verifiers

and more.

#### More Emulator Types

Sapio works *today* with CTV `then` functions because the functionality can be
emulated by a federation of signers.

Figuring out how to cleanly extend the signing server paradigm to a number of
different types of Covenant proposal (e.g. APO, TLUV, CAT) or other opcodes
could add a lot of value for making Sapio the defacto platform and proving
ground for upgrades to Bitcoin.

#### Unifying Then and Continuation

Then and Continuation really are the same thing conceptually, it would be 

#### Standard Library of useful applications / Plugins

Title says it all. There should be more off the shelf things to use!

#### Wallet Stack for Sapio Contracts

The Sapio Studio is rapidly imporving as a system for engaging with Sapio
contracts, but it's lacking in the management and storage of all of a user's
contracts. We can, and will, do a better job with this.

This includes being able to make watchtower-like functionality for Sapio. It's
coming, but will likely require a lot of new features to the language spec to
express if this then that monitoring conditions. And with features comes
complexity.

You can see hints to this in the slide earlier, being able to react to e.g.
confirmation or mempool events.

This also includes dramatic improvements needed to the GUI so that users
can understand much more deeply what contracts are doing.


#### Binary Releases

Right now Sapio is just DIY to build and run it yourself, but we really ought to
work towards stable binary releases to quickstart users.
 
#### Visual Programming for Building Sapio Contracts

 When composing together Sapio modules, I would *really* like for it to be kind
 of labview like interface for adding data or other modules, where you can
 "typecheck" that the wires (module names) are composing into slots they work.
 If that sounded like gibberish, I just mean that I want to be able to plug in a
 module hash for a NFT Sale contract into my NFT contract and have the UX give
 me real time feedback if I should be able to do that.


#### Sapio Package Manager / Deterministic Builds / Signers

 As more modules become commonly used (e.g., like NFTs) we want to ensure all
 users can build an exact copy themselves (Deterministic Builds) or that they
 can find a build signed by a number of respected code signers (Signers). While
 we can use Cargo / crates.io for the package management of our actual rust code,
 we need something to distribute the sapio wasm blobs nicely!


#### Testing

 Writing tests for Sapio contracts is hard as heck. We need some bold ideas on
 what sorts of properties would be useful to test for. Fortunately, a lot of
 properties we care about (like not wasting money) can be checked by the sapio
 library to be safe, but we still want to be able to ensure we never lose a
 users funds out of Sapio.

 #### Getting CTV Locked in

 Duh!

 <hr>

 If I get even a tenth of this completed 2022 will be a good year for Sapio.

 But I plan to get it all done.

 Perhaps with your support -- if you're an engineer or funder interested
 in helping propel this, please reach out!

 p.s. safe holiday travels!

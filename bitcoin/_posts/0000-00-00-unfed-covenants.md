title: Un-FE’d Covenants
date: 2024-11-26
---

Covenants in Bitcoin represent a method to restrict how and where coins can
move. Functional Encryption (FE) offers an exciting avenue to implement
covenants without native protocol changes. However, FE remains impractical with
current cryptographic tools. In this work, we propose a practical
implementation using an oracle-assisted model that combines off-chain
computation, key management, and a BitVM-style economic incentive structure
to enforce covenants without requiring a Bitcoin soft fork.

_Welcome to day 20 of my Bitcoin Advent Calendar. You can see the previous post

Today's post is going to be a bit lighter weight than yesterday's. We'll cover
some high level concepts around oracles and then look at some Sapio.

The genesis of this line of inquiry was a conversation with Robin Linus that led to
a pretty cool [whitepaper](https://coins.github.io/stakechains.pdf), so definitely
read that if you find this post compelling.

# Oracles

Oracles are cool! The most basic form of an useful bitcoin oracle is just a
signing key that signs transactions or reveals information that it "should"
according to some rule.

Protocols for oracles like discrete log contract oracles produce more generic
"key material reveals", that are more similar to releasing information that
allows counterparties to decrypt the relevant signature.

One of the problems with oracles is that they can equivocate, that is, sign
multiple conflicting statements.  It would be nice if we could esnure that they
would be consistent, no?

# Bonded Oracles

In order to make the oracles consistent, what we can do is set up our oracles
such that if the oracle ever signs two statements they reveal their private key
to the world. The common way that this is done is via _nonce reuse_, which is
essentially a way that you can extract a private key from a signature on
messages m1 and m2 using the same nonce r1.

While revealing a key might be punishment enough, we can do one better. We can
require that if a nonce is leaked, meaning some statement was equivocated, then
a some bitcoin protected by that key can be 'stolen' by anyone.

But this form is a little problematic, for a few reasons. Reason one is that the
oracle could cancel their bond and take it back while there are still contracts
settling with their data that they then equivocate on.

The other issue is that the funds in the punishment could be claimed by anyone,
including a miner or the oracle themselves, and especially if oracles are also miners!

To fix the first issue, we need to lock up the fund for e.g. 2 weeks and only
use the oracle for the first week to permit 1 week gap in closing. This creates a 
new issue that bonds are always expiring, but maybe that's OK.

To fix the second issue, we need a way of restricting where the funds go to definitely
be out of reach of any bad guys, e.g. burned.

## CTV Fixes This.

If you had checktemplateverify, you could stipulate that a
bonded oracle must initiate a bond redemption on chain, at which point anyone
can challenge it if they know the key and they are guaranteed sufficient time
to post a challenge.

The second fix is that CTV can stipulate that the funds *must* be burned by
sending to an OP_RETURN, not released to miners (which would be problematic if a
miner was also an oracle).

Now our oracle is ready to sign all sorts of stuff, and we can make sure that
for a given Nonce we never sign two conflicting statements.

# DLCs?

We can now use this type of oracle for a DLC protocol. We just create the contract
and then we sign+reveal using our staking key whatever messages are required. Any cheating,
and anyone who detects it can burn our money.

# Attestation Chains

One of the other cools things we can do with our Bonded oracle is to sign a chain of
attestations.

For example, we could sign message 1, and then sign message 2, and then sign message 3.

We can turn this into a "blockchain" of sorts if when we sign m2 we include a
hash of m1, and when we sign m3 we include a hash of m3.

But we can go a step further. If we're careful, we can set it up so that
'branching' on any message in the chain (by equivocating/producing a conflicting
statement) leaks the key of the bonded oracle with a trick I (think?) I came up
with. Here's roughly how it works:

```
message 1: INIT with PK K, nonce R1 for m2, 1 BTC at risk in output X
message 2: SIGN with K, R1 H(m1), nonce R2 for m3
message 3: SIGN with K, R2 H(m1), nonce R3 for m4
```

If the oracle were to ever branch, it would look like this:
```
message 1: INIT with PK K, nonce R1, 1 BTC at risk in output X
message 2: SIGN with K, R1 H(m1), nonce R2
message 3: SIGN with K, R2 H(m2), nonce R3
message 3': SIGN with K, R2 H(m3), nonce R3'
```

The leak would be able to extract K's secret key via the reuse of R2.

While it might seem that you could 'get away with it', because we verify at each
step that the last used nonce was from the prior step it cannot be forged. The
commitment to `H(mi)` also makes it more difficult for an invalid signature to
float around since from just the top you can know what all the other states
should be.

## Proof of Stake?

Essentially we've built a system for proof-of-stake on Bitcoin. Imagine you have
100BTC locked up in these contracts across 127 instances, and you want to run
some system based on it.

You can just download the message signed at state Mn and see what the majority
of signers voted for that slot.

Any signer who cheats gets their funds burned, and you'd learn to exclude them
from consensus.

If you do need to have a 'rollback', you can do it by engineering your protocol
to allow new updates to the chain of signatures to produce a rollback.

### Partial Slashing
You can even implement partial slashing. Suppose you have 10 coins in a contract under
key K1. If a cheat is detected, it authorizes a txn which burns 2 and puts the
remaining 8 into key K2. The next round of slashing could put 6.4 under K3.

# Alternatives to Burning

Burning sats is sad. What if instead of a burn, coins went into an annuity that
would be claimable 100 years from now? That way, no economic agents around today
can plan to cheat and capture the value of it, but the burned coins can serve a
real function. While this is slightly less secure than a full burn, it's also
more secure since it creates an incentive to continue to build the chain.

# Implementing a Staked Signer

To begin, we'll define some 'type tags'. This is a technique in rust where we
define empty structs that let us build a little state machine in the type
system. You can read more on the technique
[here](https://learn.sapio-lang.org/ch08-01-state-machines.html).

```rust
/// # Operational State
/// State where stakes should be recognized for voting
#[derive(JsonSchema, Deserialize)]
pub struct Operational;
/// # Closing State
/// State where stakes are closing and waiting evidence of misbehavior
#[derive(JsonSchema, Deserialize)]
struct Closing;
/// # Staking States (Operational, Closing)
/// enum trait for states
pub trait StakingState {}
impl StakingState for Operational {}
impl StakingState for Closing {}
```

Next, we'll define an interface that an implementation of a Staked Signer should
implement:

By default something that is declared is given a default not-present implementation.

```rust
/// Functional Interface for Staking Contracts
pub trait StakerInterface
where
    Self: Sized,
{
    decl_guard!(
        /// The key used to sign messages
        staking_key
    );
    decl_guard!(
        /// the clause to begin a close process
        begin_redeem_key
    );
    decl_guard!(
        /// the clause to finish a close process
        finish_redeem_key
    );
    decl_then!(
        /// The transition from Operational to Closing
        begin_redeem
    );

    /// Why would anyone ever cheat!!
    #[then(guarded_by = "[Self::staking_key]")]
    fn cheated(self, ctx: sapio::Context) {
        let f = ctx.funds();
        ctx.template()
            // commit to metadata here for convenience, but really could be anywhere!
            // exercise for reader: what if we plugged in another instance of StakerInterface
            // that:
            // 1. switches to a new, unburned key
            // 2. pays 80% to the new StakerInterface
            // 3. pays 20% to an annuity that pays miners over e.g. 1000 blocks
            //    at some point in the far future.
            .add_output(f, &Compiled::from_op_return(&self.data.as_inner()[..])?, None)?
            .into()
    }
}

/// We can delcare the Contract impl for all valid Staker<T>
impl<T: 'static + StakingState> Contract for Staker<T>
where
    Staker<T>: StakerInterface,
    T: StakingState,
{
    declare! {then, Self::begin_redeem, Self::cheated}
    declare! {finish, Self::finish_redeem_key}
    declare! {non updatable}
}
```


Next, we'll define the data required for our staker:
```rust
/// # Staker: A Bonded Signing Contract
/// Staker is a contract that proceeds from Operational -> Closing
/// During it's lifetime, many things can be signed with signing_key,
/// but should the key ever leak (e.g., via nonce reuse) the bonded
/// funds can be burned.
///
/// Burning is important v.s. miner fee because otherwise the staker
/// can bribe (or be a miner themselves) to cheat.
#[derive(JsonSchema, Deserialize)]
pub struct Staker<T: StakingState> {
    /// # Timeout
    /// How long to wait for evidence after closing
    timeout: AnyRelTimeLock,
    /// # Signing Key
    /// The key that if leaked can burn funds
    signing_key: PublicKey,
    /// # Redemption Key
    /// The key that will be used to control & return the redeemed funds
    redeeming_key: PublicKey,
    /// # Data
    /// Arbitrary hash of metadata that is needed to start the attestation chain
    data: sha256::Hash,
    /// current contract state.
    #[serde(skip, default)]
    state: PhantomData<T>,
}
```

Next, we'll define the StakerInterface when our channel is operational. At this phase,
funds can either be burnt or the redeeming key can start the process of withdrawing.

```rust
impl StakerInterface for Staker<Operational> {
    /// redeeming key
    #[guard]
    fn begin_redeem_key(self, _ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.redeeming_key)
    }
    /// begin redemption process
    #[then(guarded_by = "[Self::begin_redeem_key]")]
    fn begin_redeem(self, ctx: sapio::Context) {
        let f = ctx.funds();
        ctx.template()
            .add_output(
                f,
                &Staker::<Closing> {
                    state: Default::default(),
                    timeout: self.timeout,
                    signing_key: self.signing_key,
                    redeeming_key: self.redeeming_key,
                },
                None,
            )?
            .into()
    }
    /// staking key
    #[guard]
    fn staking_key(self, _ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.signing_key)
    }
}
```

Lastly, for closing we should not be able to "loop" back into Closing or
Operational, so we do not implement the `begin_redeem` logic.
```rust
impl StakerInterface for Staker<Closing> {
    #[guard]
    fn finish_redeem_key(self, _ctx: Context) {
        Clause::And(vec![Clause::Key(self.redeeming_key), self.timeout.into()])
    }
    #[guard]
    fn staking_key(self, _ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.signing_key)
    }
}
```


## Attestation Chain

In order to start the attestation chain, the `data` field should be the hash of something like:

```rust
struct AttestationStart {
    /// # Nonce
    /// a nonce element
    first_nonce: [0u8; 32],
    /// # Key
    /// the key to sign with (for convenience, should match the StakedSigner's
    /// staking key)
    key: PublicKey,
    /// # Purpose
    /// useful to have some sort of description (machine readable) of what this attestor
    /// is signing for
    purpose: Vec<u8>
}
```

To start using the attestation chain, we build a linked list of `Attest`
signatures as described below:

```rust
enum Either<T, U> {
    Left(T),
    Right(U)
}
struct Attest {
    /// # Signature
    /// the signature over the below data fields
    sig: Signature,
    /// # Message
    /// whatever info the protocol expects to be signed
    message: Vec<u8>,
    /// # Nonce
    /// a nonce element
    next_nonce: [0u8; 32],
    /// # Height
    /// what # signature is this
    height: u64,
    /// # Previous Attestation
    /// the last attestation. we either keep a hash or the actual value
    prev: Either<Hash, Either<Box<Attest>, AttestationStart>>
}
```

It would be possible -- but perhaps overkill -- to instead encode this structure
as a Sapio contract with `continuation` branches. I'll leave that as an exercise
for the reader for now!


# Galaxy Brain Time

What if we used this staked signer to coordinate a decentralized mining pool
where the stakers sign off on work shares they have seen...

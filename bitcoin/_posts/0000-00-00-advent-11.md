## You are going to die.

Merry Christmas! Hopefully not any time soon, but one of these days you will shuffle off this mortal coil.

When that day comes, how will you give your loved ones your hard earned bitcoin?

You do have a plan, right?

This post is a continuation of the last post on Vaults. Whereas Vaults focus on trying to keep your coins away from someone, Inheritance focuses on making sure someone does get your coins. Basically opposites!

## Basic Bitcoin Plans

Let's say you're a smarty pants and you set the following system up:

```
(2-of-3 Multisig of my keys) OR (After 1 year, 3-of-5 Multisig of my 4 family members keys and 1 lawyer to tie break)
```

Under this setup, you can spend your funds secured by a multisig. You have to
spend them once a year to keep your greedy family away, but that's OK.

Until one day, you perish in a boating accident (shouldn't have gone to that Flamin' Hot Cheetos Yach Party in Miami).

A year goes by, no one knows where your 2-of-3 keys are, and so the family's
backup keys go online.

They raid your files and find a utxoset backup with descriptors and know how to
combine their keys (that you made for them most likely...) with offline signing
devices to sign a PSBT, and the money comes out.

If the family can't agree, a Lawyer who has your will can tie break the execution.

Except wait...

## Your kids are assholes, just like your spouse

So your piece of shit husband/wife doesn't think the kids should get anything (RIP
college fund), so count them out on signing the tuition payments.

Now we're down to your 3 kids agreeing and your 1 lawyer.

Your Lawyer thinks your spouse has a bit of a case, so the whole things in
probate as far as they are concerned.

And the kids? Well, the kids don't want to go to college. You just gifted them
42069 sats each, enough to pay for a ticket on Elon Musk's spaceship. So they
get together one night, withdraw all the money, and go to Mars. Or the Casino.
Little Jimmy has never seen so much money, so he goes to Vegas for a last huzzah
before the Mars trip, but he blows it all. So Jimmy stays behind, satless, and
the other kids go to mars.

## Well That Sucked

And it didn't have to! What if you could express your last will and testament in
Bitcoin transactions instead of in messy messy multisigs. You Can! Today! No new
features required (although they'd sure be nice...).

# Building Inheritence Schemes with Sapio

You can make inheritence schemes with Sapio! While it does benefit from having
CTV enabled for various reasons, technically it can work decently without CTV by
pre-signing transactions with a CTV emulator.

Here we'll develop some interesting primitives that can be used to make various
inheritence guarantees.

## Making a better Dead Man Switch

First off, let's make a better dead man switch. Recall we had to move our funds once a year because of the timelocks.

That was dumb.

Instead, let's make a challenge of liveness! (again, deep apologies on these
examples, I'm a bit behind on the series so haven't checked as closely as I
would usually...)

```rust
/// Opening state of a DeadManSwitch
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Alive {
    /// Key needed to claim I'm dead
    is_dead: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    /// If someone says i'm dead but I'm alive, backup wallet address
    is_live: bitcoin::Address,
    /// My normal spending key (note: could be a Clause instead...)
    key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    /// How long you have to claim you're not dead
    timeout: RelTime,
    /// Addresses for CPFP Anchor Outputs
    is_dead_cpfp: bitcoin::Address,
    is_live_cpfp: bitcoin::Address,
}

impl Alive {
    #[guard]
    fn is_dead_sig(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.is_dead.clone())
    }
    /// only allow the is_dead key to transition to a CheckIfDead 
    #[then(guarded_by="[Self::is_dead_sig]")]
    fn am_i_dead(self, ctx: Context) {
        let dust = Amount::from_sat(600);
        let amt = ctx.funds();
        ctx.template()
            // Send all but some dust to CheckIfDead
            .add_output(amt - dust, &CheckIfDead(self.clone()), None)?
            // used for CPFP
            .add_output(
                dust,
                &Compiled::from_address(self.is_dead_cpfp.clone(), None),
                None,
            )?
            .into()
    }
    /// Allow spending like normal
    #[guard]
    fn spend(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.key.clone())
    }
}

impl Contract for Alive {
    declare! {finish, Self::spend}
    declare! {then, Self::am_i_dead}
}

/// All the info we need is in Alive struct already...
struct CheckIfDead(Alive);
impl CheckIfDead {
    /// we're dead after the timeout and is_dead key signs to take the money
    #[guard]
    fn is_dead(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::And(vec![Clause::Key(self.0.is_dead.clone()), self.0.timeout.clone().into()])
    }

    /// signature required for liveness claim
    #[guard]
    fn alive_auth(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::Key(self.key.clone())
    }
    /// um excuse me i'm actually alive
    #[then(guarded_by="[Self::alive_auth]")]
    fn im_alive(self, ctx: Context) {
        let dust = Amount::from_sat(600);
        let amt = ctx.funds();
        ctx.template()
            /// Send funds to the backup address!
            .add_output(
                amt - dust,
                &Compiled::from_address(self.0.is_live.clone(), None),
                None,
            )?
            /// Dust for CPFP-ing
            .add_output(
                dust,
                &Compiled::from_address(self.0.is_live_cpfp.clone(), None),
                None,
            )?
            .into()
    }
}

impl Contract for CheckIfDead {
    declare! {finish, Self::is_dead}
    declare! {then, Self::im_alive}
}
```


In this example, the funds start in a state of Alive, until a challenger calls
`Alive::am_i_dead` or the original owner spends the coin. After the call of
`Alive::am_i_dead`, the contract transitions to CheckIfDead state. From this state,
the owner has `timeout` (either time or blocks) time to move the coin to their
key, or else the claimer of the death can spend using `CheckIfDead::is_dead`.

Of course, we can clean up this contract in various ways (e.g., making the
destination if dead generic). That could look something like this:

```rust
struct Alive {
    is_dead_cpfp: bitcoin::Address,
    is_live_cpfp: bitcoin::Address,
    // note that this permits composing Alive with some arbitrary function
    is_dead: &dyn Fn(ctx: Context, cpfp: bitcoin::Address) -> TxTmplIt,
    is_live: bitcoin::Address,
    key: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    timeout: RelTime,
}

impl CheckIfDead {
    #[then]
    fn is_dead(self, ctx: Context) {
        self.0.is_dead(ctx, self.0.is_dead_cpfp.clone())
    }
}
```

This kind of dead man switch is much more reliable than having slowly eroding
timelocks since it doesn't require regular transaction refreshing, which was the
source of [a bug in Blockstream's federation
code](https://medium.com/blockstream/patching-the-liquid-timelock-issue-b4b2f5f9a973).
It also requires an explicit action to claim a lack of liveness, which also
gives information about the trustworthiness of your kids (or any exploits of
their signers).

## Not so fast

What if we want to make sure that little Jimmy and his gambling addiction don't
blow it all at once... Maybe if instead of giving Jimmy one big lump sum, we
could give a little bit every month. Then maybe he'd be better off! This is
basically an Annuity contract.

Now let's have a look at an annuity contract.

```rust
struct Annuity {
    to: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    amount: bitcoin::Amount,
    period: AnyRelTime
}

const MIN_PAYOUT: bitcoin::Amount = bitcoin::Amount::from_sat(10000);
impl Annuity {
    #[then]
    fn claim(self, ctx:Context) {
        let amt = ctx.funds();
        // Basically, while there are funds left this contract recurses to itself,
        // until there's only a little bit left over.
        // No need for CPFP since we can spend from the `to` output for CPFP.
        if amt - self.amount > MIN_PAYOUT {
            ctx.template()
                .add_output(self.amount, &self.to, None)?
                .add_output(amt - self.amount, &self, None)?
                .set_sequence(-1, self.period.into())?
                .into()
        } else if amt > 0 {
            ctx.template()
                .add_output(amt, &self.to, None)?
                .set_sequence(-1, self.period.into())?
                .into()
        } else {
            // nothing left to claim
            empty()
        }
    }
}

```

We could instead "transpose" an annuity into a non-serialized form. This would
basically be a big transaction that has N outputs with locktimes on claiming
each. However this has a few drawbacks:

1. Claims are non-serialized, which means that relative timelocks can only last
at most 2 years. Therefore only absolute timelocks may be used.

1. You might want to make it possible for another entity to counterclaim Jimmy's
funds back, perhaps if he also died (talk about bad luck). In the transposed version, you would need to make N proof-of-life challenges v.s. just one[^recursion].

1. You would have to pay more fees all at once (although less fees overall if feerates increase or stay flat).

1. It's less extensible -- for example, it would be possible to do a lot of cool
things with serialization of payouts (e.g., allowing oracles to inflation adjust
payout rate).




[^recursion]: Note this is a case where unrolling can be used, but the contract sizes can blow up kinda quick, so careful programming might be needed or you might need to say that it can only be claimed that Jimmy is dead once or twice before he just gets all the money. Recursive covenants would not nescessarily have this issue.

## Splits

Remember our annoying spouse, bad lawyer, etc? Well, instead of giving them a multisig, imagine
we use the split function as the end output from our CheckIfDead:

```rust
fn split(ctx: Context, cpfp: bitcoin::Address) -> TxTmplIt {
    let dust = Amount::from_sat(600);
    let amt = ctx.funds() - dust;
    let mut ctx.template()
       .add_output(dust, &Compiled::from_address(cpfp, None), None)?
       .add_output(amt*0.5, &from_somewhere::spouse_annuity, None)?
       .add_output(amt * 0.1666, &from_somewhere::kids_annuity[0], None)?
       .add_output(amt*0.1666, &from_somewhere::kids_annuity[1], None)?
       .add_output(amt*0.1666, &from_somewhere::kids_annuity[2], None)?
       .into()
}
```

This way we don't rely on any pesky disagreement over what to sign, the funds
are split exactly how we like.

## Oracles and Lawyers

Lastly, it is possible to bake into these contracts all sorts of
conditionallity.

For example, imagine an Annuity that only makes payouts if a University
Attendance Validator signs your tuition payment, otherwise you get the coins on
your 25th Birthday.

```rust
struct Tuition {
    /// keep this key secret from the school
    to: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    enrolled: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    school: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    amount: bitcoin::Amount,
    period: AnyRelTime,
    birthday: AbsTime,
}

const MIN_PAYOUT: bitcoin::Amount = bitcoin::Amount::from_sat(10000);
impl Tuition {
    #[guard]
    fn enrolled(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::And(vec![Clause::Key(self.enrolled), Clause::Key(self.to)])
    }
    #[then(guarded_by="[Self::enrolled]")]
    fn claim(self, ctx:Context) {
        let amt = ctx.funds();
        if amt - self.amount > MIN_PAYOUT {
            // send money to school
            ctx.template()
                .add_output(self.amount, &self.enrolled, None)?
                .add_output(amt - self.amount, &self, None)?
                .set_sequence(-1, self.period.into())?
                .into()
        } else if amt > 0 {
            // give the change to child
            ctx.template()
                .add_output(amt, &self.to, None)?
                .set_sequence(-1, self.period.into())?
                .into()
        } else {
            empty()
        }
    }
    #[guard]
    fn spend(self, ctx: Context) {
        Clause::And(vec![self.birthday.into(), Clause::Key(self.to)])
    }
}
```

The oracle can't really steal funds here -- they can only sign the already
agreed on txn and get the tuition payment to the "school" network. And on the
specified Birthday, if not used for tuition, the funds go to the child directly.


# Where do these live?

In theory what you'd end up doing is attaching these to every coin in you wallet
under a dead-man switch.

Ideally, you'd put enough under your main "structured" splits that you're not
moving all to often and then you would have the rest go into less structured
stuff.  E.g., the college fund coins you might touch less frequently than the
coins for general annuity. You can also sequence some things using absolute
timelocks, for example.

In an ideal world you would have a wallet agent that is aware of all your UTXOs
and your will and testament state and makes sure to regenerate the correct
conditions whenever you spend and then store them durably, but that's a bit
futuristic for the time being.  With CTV the story is a bit better, as for many
designs you could distribute a WASM bundle for your wallet to your family and
they could use that to generate all the transactions given an output, without
needing to have every presigned transaction saved.

This does demonstrate a relative strength for the account model, it's much
easier to keep all your funds in once account and write globally correct
inheritence vault logic around it for all your funds, computed across
percentages. No matter the UTXO model covenant, that someone might have multiple
UTXOs poses an inherent challenge in doing this kind of stuff properly.

# What else?

Well, this is just a small sampling of things you could do. Part of the power of
Sapio is that I hope you're feeling inspired to make your own bespoke
inhertience scheme in it! No one size fits all, ever, but perhaps with the power
of Sapio available to the world we'll see a lot more experimentation with what's
possible.

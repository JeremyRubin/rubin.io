abstract: "Draft proposal for Delbrag, a BitVM improvement that uses garbled circuits to reduce on-chain costs while preserving fraud-proof style verification."
---

Delbrag is a paper explaining how garbled circuits can be applied to make BitVM style constructs fraud proofs substantially more efficient, at the cost of increased out-of-band information exchange.

Delbrag was originally authored in November, 2024, but wasn't published sooner as the author procrastinated.

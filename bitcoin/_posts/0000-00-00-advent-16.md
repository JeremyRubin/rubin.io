Who here has some ERC-20s or 721s[^rock]? Anyone? No one? Whatever.

[^rock]: if you've been living under a big rock, ICO tokens and NFTs.

The Punchline is that a lotta fuss goes into Ethereum smart contracts being
Turing Complete but guess what? Neither ERC-20 nor 721 really have anything to
do with being Turing Complete. What they do have to do with is having a
tightly defined interface that can integrate into other applications nicely.

This is great news for Bitcoin. It means that a lot of the cool stuff happening
in eth-land isn't really about Turing Completeness, it's about just defining
really kickass interfaces for the things we're trying to do.

In the last few posts, we already saw examples of composability. We took a bunch
of concepts and were able to nest them inside of each other to make
Decentralized Coordination Free Mining Pools.  But we can do a lot more with
composability than just compose ideas togehter by hand. In this post I'll give
you a little sampler of different types of programmatic composability and interfaces,
like the ERC-20 and 721.

## Address Composability

Because many Sapio contracts can be made completely noninteractively (with CTV
or an Oracle you'll trust to be online later), if you compile a Sapio contract
and get an address you can just plug it in somewhere and it "composes" and you
can link it later. We saw this earlier with the ability to make a channel
address and send it to an exchange.

However, for Sapio if you just do an Address it won't necessarily have the
understanding of what that address is for so you won't get any of the Sapio
"rich" features.

### Pre-Compiled

You can also take not just an address, but an entire (json-serialized?) Compiled
object that would include all the relevant metadata.


## Rust Generic Types Composability

Well, if you're a rust programmer this basically boils down to rust types rule!
We'll give a couple examples.

The simplest example is just composing directly in a function: 
```rust
#[then]
fn some_function(self, ctx: Context) {
    ctx.template()
        .add_output(ctx.funds(), &SomeOtherContract{/**/}, None)?
        .into()
}
```

What if we want to pass any Contract as an argument for a Contract? Simple:

```rust
struct X {
    a : Box<dyn Contract>
}
```
What if we want to restrict it a little bit more? We can use a trait bound.
Now only Y (or anything implementing GoodContract) can be plugged in.
```rust
trait GoodContract : Contract {
    decl_then!{some_thing}
}
struct Y {
}
impl GoodContract for Y {
    #[then]
    fn some_thing(self, ctx: Context) {
        empty()
    }
}
impl Contract for Y {
    declare!{then, Self::some_thing}
}
struct X<T: GoodContract> {
    a : Box<dyn GoodContract>,
    // note the inner type of a and b don't have to match
    b : Box<dyn GoodContract>
}
```

Boxing gives us some power to be Generic at runtime, but we can also do some
more "compile time" logic. This can have some advantages, e.g., if we want to
guarantee that types are the same.

```rust
struct X<T : Contract, U: GoodContract> {
    a : T, 
    b : T
    // a more specific concrete type -- could be a T even
    c: U,
    d: U,
}
```

Sometimes it can be helpful to wrap things in functions, like we saw in the Vaults post.

```rust
struct X<T: Contract>
    // This lets us stub in whatever we want for a function
    a : Box<Fn(Self, Context) -> TxTmplIt>,
    // this lets us get back any contract
    b : Box<Fn(Self, Context) -> Box<dyn Contract>>,
    // this lets us get back a specific contract
    c : Box<Fn(Self, Context) -> T,
}
```


Clearly there's a lot to do with the rust type system and making components.

It would even be possible to make certain types of 'unchecked' type traits,
for example:

```rust
trait Reusable {}
struct AlsoReusable<T> {
    a: T,
}
// Only reusable if T Reusable
impl<T> Reusable for AlsoReusable<T> where T: Reusable {}
```

The `Reusable` tag could be used to tag contract components that would be "reuse
safe".  E.g., an HTLC or HTLC containing component would not be reuse safe since
hashes could be revealed. While reusability isn't "proven" -- that's up to the
author to check -- these types of traits can help us reason about the properties
of compositions of programs more safely. Unfortunately, Rust lacks negative
trait bounds (i.e., Not-Reusable), so you can't reason about certain types of things.

### Inheritence
We don't have a fantastic way to do inheritence in Sapio presently. But stay
tuned!  For now, then best you get is that you can do traits (like
`GoodContract`).

## Cross Module Composability & WASM

One of the goals of Sapio is to be able to create contract modules with a
well-defined API Boundary that communicates with JSONs and is "typed" with
JSONSchema. This means that the Sapio modules can be running anywhere (e.g., a
remote server) and we can treat it like any other component.

Another goal of Sapio is to make it possible to compile modules into standalone
WASM modules. WASM stands for Web Assembly, it's basically a small deterministic
computer emulator program format so we can compile our programs and run them
anywhere that the WASM interpreter is available.

Combining these two goals, it's possible for one Sapio program to dynamically
load another as a WASM module. This means we can come up with a component,
compile it, and then link to it later from somewhere else. For example, we could
have a Payment Pool where we make each person's leaf node a WASM module of their
choice, that could be something like a Channel, a Vault, or anything that
satisfies a "Payment Pool Payout Interface".

For example, suppose we wanted to a generic API for making a batched
payment.

### Defining the Interface
First, we define a payment that we want to batch.
```rust
/// A payment to a specific address
pub struct Payment {
    /// # Amount (btc)
    /// The amount to send
    pub amount: AmountF64,
    /// # Address
    /// The Address to send to
    pub address: bitcoin::Address,
}
```
Next, we define the full API that we want. _Naming and versioning is still a
something we need to work on in the Sapio ecosystem, but for now it makes sense
to be verbose and include a version._

```rust
pub struct BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1 {
    pub payments: Vec<Payment>,
    /// # Feerate (Bitcoin per byte)
    pub feerate_per_byte: AmountF64 
}
```

Lastly, to finish defining the API, we have to do something really gross looking
in order to make it automatically checkable -- this is essentially this is what the
user defined `BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1` is going to verify modules are able to 
understand. This is going to be improved in Sapio over time for better typechecking!
```rust
impl SapioJSONTrait for BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1 {
    fn get_example_for_api_checking() -> Value {
        #[derive(Serialize)]
        enum Versions {
            BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1),
        }
        serde_json::to_value(Versions::BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(
            BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1 {
                payments: vec![],
                feerate_per_byte: Amount::from_sat(0).into(),
            },
        ))
        .unwrap()
    }
}
```
### Implementing the Interface

Let's say that we want to make a contract like `TreePay` implement
`BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1`. What do we need to do?

First, let's get the boring stuff out of the way, we need to make the `TreePay`
module understand that it should support `BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1`.
```rust
/// # Different Calling Conventions to create a Treepay
enum Versions {
    /// # Standard Tree Pay
    TreePay(TreePay),
    /// # Batching Trait API
    BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1),
}

REGISTER![[TreePay, Versions], "logo.png"];
```

Next, we just need to define logic converting the data provided in
`BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1` into a `TreePay`. Since `BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1` 
is really basic, we need to pick values for the other fields.

```rust
impl From<BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1> for TreePay {
    fn from(args: BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1) -> Self {
        TreePay {
            participants: args.payments,
            radix: 4,
            // estimate fees to be 4 outputs and 1 input + change
            fee_sats_per_tx: args.feerate_per_byte * ((4 * 41) + 41 + 10),
            timelock_backpressure: None,
        }
    }
}
impl From<Versions> for TreePay {
    fn from(v: Versions) -> TreePay {
        match v {
            Versions::TreePay(v) => v,
            Versions::BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1(v) => v.into(),
        }
    }
}
```


### Using the Interface


To use this `BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1`, we can just define a struct as follows,
and when we deserialize it will be automatically verified to have declared a
fitting API.

```rust
pub struct RequiresABatch {
    /// # Which Plugin to Use
    /// Specify which contract plugin to call out to.
    handle: SapioHostAPI<BatchingTraitVersion0_1_1>,
}
```

The `SapioHostAPI` handle can be either a human readable name (like
"user_preferences.batching" or "org.judica.modules.batchpay.latest") and looked
up locally, or it could be an exact hash of the specific module to use.

We can then use the handle to resolve and compile against the third party module.
Because the module lives in an entirely separate WASM execution context,
we don't need to worry about it corrupting our module or being able to access
information we don't provide it.

_Welcome to day 25 of my Bitcoin Advent Calendar. You can see the previous post
[here](/bitcoin/2021/12/21/advent-24/) or subscribe at

The title of this article is a joke. Gotcha!

![Bart Simpson writing "DAOs are just fancy multisigs".](/public/img/bitcoin/advent/dao/bart.png)

Decentralized Autonomous Organization is pretty much what's called an _[orphan
initialism](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003555.html)_.
So while DAO doesn't really mean anything is decentralized, autonomous, or an
organization, but the term DAO has stuck around anyways. Even moreso than NFT!
More or less, DAOs are just fancy multisigs. But they've been used for all sorts
of things, ranging from attempting to buy the US Constitution as a group,
investing in startups, buying Ross Ulbricht's NFTs, or maybe even buying my
undies. 

 ![yes this is a joke](/public/img/bitcoin/advent/dao/nytimes.jpeg)

This post has some required reading. You have to have read through at least up
to [payment pools](/bitcoin/2021/12/10/advent-13/) in the advent calendar, but
ideally you'd have read all the posts...


So how will fancy-multisigs save Bitcoin? In this post we'll work through an
example of building a DAO to fund Bitcoin Core Developers, like a Bitcoin native
Gitcoin competitor.
<hr>

# What do we want from our DAO:

The DAO will serve three functions:

1. To Add members who pay in
2. To make Payments if a Majority of the payers by value vote
3. To mint commemorative NFTs

## Majority rules

DAOs are little democracies, and as such we need a voting scheme to do rule
changes whereby a threshold (e.g., 51%) decides what happens next. We have two
options, we can either count individuals as equal, or we can weight by amount of
funds contributed. We can do any threshold we like, it's just "this many people
could steal the whole pot".

For this post, we'll do the weighted by funds contributed because that feels
closer to what's happening in Ethereum land. Unfortunately a couple components
around generated arbitrary weighted signatures[^frost] just "aren't quite there" or have
messy tradeoffs so we won't consider those -- yet. Instead we'll just make a silly
limit: we will allow at most 24 participants[^combo].


[^frost]: FROST allows n-M threshold Schnorr signatures, which can turn into a
weighted solution by making M the total value and each party have W amount of
keys for their contribution. But this scales poorly because you need to exchange
keys and signatures linear in the Amount, which is up to a 51-bit number.
[^combo]: We are going to brute force all the N-N key combinations, so we pick a
low number like 24 and things stay 'small' enough.

## Implementing a DAO


First let's define the basics. A DAO should have Members who each are ID'd by a
key and have an amount of votes.

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema, Serialize, Clone)]
struct Member {
    relative_votes: u64,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema, Clone)]
struct Dao {
    /// # Pool Members
    /// map of all initial balances as PK to BTC
    members: BTreeMap<PublicKey, Member>,
    /// The current sequence number (for authenticating state updates)
    sequence: u64,
}

impl Contract for Dao {
    declare! {updatable<Proposal>, Self::hold_vote}
}
```

Members can hold a vote on a proposal of some kind. Let's do proposals
that can make payments, mint NFTs, or add some noobs:

```rust
/// New Update message for generating a transaction from.
#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema, Serialize)]
enum Proposal {
    /// # Payments
    /// A mapping of public key in members to signed list of payouts with a fee rate.
    Payments {
        payments: BTreeMap<PublicKey, AmountU64>,
        // Some purpose for this proposal, as a String.
        reason: String,
    },
    /// # Mint
    /// Make some NFTs
    Mint {
        minting_module: SapioHostAPI<Mint_NFT_Trait_Version_0_1_0>,
        mint_data: Mint_NFT_Trait_Version_0_1_0,
    },
    /// # Add People
    Add {
        noobs: BTreeMap<PublicKey, Member>,
    },
    None,
}
/// required...
impl Default for Proposal {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Proposal::None
    }
}
impl StatefulArgumentsTrait for Proposal {}

/// helper for rust type system issue
fn default_coerce(k: <Dao as Contract>::StatefulArguments) -> Result<Proposal, CompilationError> {
    Ok(k)
}

```

Now we can implement the main logic of the DAO. We want it to compute keys for
the majority to rule, and we want it to allow a majority to vote on a Proposal.
Note how when we make a payment, unlike in the Payment Pool, we decrease all
member's proportional ownership in the pool[^rat], so that new owners are not
disadvantaged. But we could change that, to time-weight how long members have
been part of the DAO as well, or give people 'special voting weight'
disconnected from money added. It's really up to whatever you want...

[^rat]: please please if you're implementing this for real use rational types not floats.

We'll implement the logic for each type of proposal (minting, adding, or paying).
```rust
impl Dao {
    /// Sum Up all the balances
    fn total(&self) -> Amount {
        Amount::from_sat(self.members.iter().map(|e| e.1.relative_votes).sum::<u64>())
    }
    /// all signed the transaction!
    #[guard]
    fn majority_rules(self, _ctx: Context) {
        let ppl = self
            .members
            .iter()
            .map(|(m, d)| (m.clone(), d.relative_votes))
            .collect();
        // TODO: we should probably make guards return Result...
        key_groups_to_clause(
            &compute_key_groups(self.total().as_sat() / 2, ppl).expect("Well Formed"),
        )
    }
    /// This Function will create a proposed transaction that is safe to sign
    /// given a list of data from participants.
    #[continuation(
        web_api,
        guarded_by = "[Self::majority_rules]",
        coerce_args = "default_coerce"
    )]
    fn hold_vote(self, ctx: Context, update: Proposal) {
        // don't allow empty updates.
        match update {
            Proposal::None => empty(),
            Proposal::Mint {
                minting_module,
                mint_data,
            } => {
                let key = minting_module.key;
                // let's now compile a new 'mint' of the NFT
                let new_nft_contract = Ok(CreateArgs {
                    context: ContextualArguments {
                        amount: ctx.funds(),
                        network: ctx.network,

                })
                .and_then(serde_json::to_value)
                .map(|args| create_contract_by_key(&key, args, Amount::from_sat(0)))

                    .into()
            }
            Proposal::Add { mut noobs } => {
                let adding = Amount::from_sat(noobs.values().map(|m| m.relative_votes).sum());
                let mut new = self.clone();
                noobs.iter_mut().for_each(|(pk, m)| {
                    new.members

                });
                let f = ctx.funds();

                    .into()
            }
            Proposal::Payments { payments } => {
                if payments.is_empty() {
                    return empty();
                }
                // collect members with updated balances here
                let spent = payments
                    .values()
                    .cloned()
                    .map(Amount::from)
                    .fold(Amount::from_sat(0), |a, b| a + b.into());
                let balance = 1.0 - (spent.as_btc() / self.total().as_btc());
                let mut new_members = self.members.clone();
                new_members.values_mut().for_each(|m| {
                    m.relative_votes = (m.relative_votes as f64 * balance).round() as u64;
                });
                // for each payment...
                // Send any leftover funds to a new pool
                let change = Dao {
                    members: new_members,
                    sequence: self.sequence + 1,
                };

                // optional: we could commit to the reason somewhere in metadata 
                // e.g. a tapleaf branch... we don't do this here because meh.
                for (key, amount) in payments {
                    tmpl = tmpl.add_output(amount.try_into()?, &key, None)?;
                }
                tmpl.into()
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Lastly, we need some super special sneaky algorithm fun to implement signing authorities
based on majority value. As noted, special uses of FROST could replace this, or future
research on better weighted key protocols.

For now, we limit ourselves to 25 keys so that compilation isn't too slow. We can afford
having hundreds of thousands or millions of groups because of Taproot :).
```rust
fn key_groups_to_clause<T>(v: &(Vec<(PublicKey, T)>, Vec<u32>)) -> Clause {
    Clause::Threshold(
        1,
        v.1.iter()
            .map(|m| {
                Clause::And(
                    v.0.iter()
                        .enumerate()
                        .filter_map(|(i, (k, _))| {
                            if m & (1 << i) != 0 {
                                Some(k.clone())
                            } else {
                                None
                            }
                        })
                        .map(Clause::Key)
                        .collect(),
                )
            })
            .collect(),
    )
}
fn compute_key_groups(
    threshold: u64,
    mut el: Vec<(PublicKey, u64)>,

All done! Not too bad huh? I think you're really getting the hang of this thing!

# Using a DAO

Now that we have this DAO we can get together a group of people and share a UTXO.

With that shared balance, we can get everyone in some kind of chat room and 'govern'
what proposals folks want to vote on.

In particular, I would be very excited to see DAOs emerge for funding Bitcoin
Developers.  This type of structure can potentially help folks communally
allocate capital. Often times the biggest barrier is finding deals that make
sense, and DAOs would enable you to share with a group of friends and they could
make decisions for you.

It would even be possible to create DAOs on behalf of third parties and fund
them. For example, let's say I get PKs for 10 devs I like and put a 10 BTC into
it and set the shares up so that there is a 'leader' with 30%, and the rest
split 70% of voting shares. The leader could just steal the money with another
21%, but would they? I hope not! Instead, they can vote on good things as
intended.  It'd also be possible for the DAO creator to embed an 'oversight
comittee' that can yank the funds if not being used.

Minting NFTs is kind of a cool feature since anyone can see they came from the
DAO if they track the DAO's state updates (conceivably these get published for
auditing). NFTs could be issued as medals of honor for devs who follow their
grants. Or, if you really like NFTs, they could be used to issue software
licenses in exchange for contributing funds to the DAO operators.


# Does this need CTV?

Nope. Just a fancy multisig, right?

Where CTV is useful is if we want to vote on proposals to put things into CTV
contracts, like subscriptions to developer grants, opening channels, etc.
Imagine the developer gets a contract where they get paid out every week, but
there is a auditing comittee that can be used to terminate the subscription and
return funds to the DAO if misbehavior is detected.

While you don't need CTV in the DAO backbone, it would help open up new use
cases.

It would also be possible to add some 'liveness' smooth degradations of the DAO,
whereby half the majority (e.g., if majority is 50%, 25%) could vote that the
DAO is dead, and after a period of time for the majority recovery, distribute
the funds on a pre-comitted schedule.

We don't show that here, but it wouldn't be too hard now would it?

# Generalizing

One could go ahead and implement a DAO trait that all DAOs could share and build
a common UX for managing DAOs with a wide variety of custom logic...

It'd also be possible to have a DAO backbone which is a single UTXO, and have
other UTXOs 'owned' by the DAO that can get merged in later as a proposal. This
way contributions to the DAO don't always require a state update from the DAO
itself.

For future work :)

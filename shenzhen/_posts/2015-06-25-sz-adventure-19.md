The Zipper factory tour was courtesy of [Daniel Liang](http://danielliang.com/randomness/).
This was one of the more detailed tours; there's a whole lot that goes into a zipper! Daniel's factory
is also super large as it is essentially end-to-end, raw materials go in such as bulk plastic and metal, and 
finished spools of zipper material and zips come out.






## Filament Making

Filaments are used to make the plastic zipping ribs.

They start out as raw plastic pelts.

If a black color is desired, a small amount of dye pellets are added.

The pellets go into the hopper (far left) to be melted down/mixed and then extruded.

Unfortunately, I didn't get great pictures of this part, but the filaments are
pulled through, cooled, and then spooled.

Maybe this picture will help you, but I can't really make sense of it.

## Tape Weaving


Tapes are woven from some nylon/cotton thread. I'm not sure if this is made on
site or not, but I think if I recall it is a separate factory.


The thread goes into weaving machines.

# Zip Integrating

These machines knit in the filaments into a plastic zipper. This is either onto a woven tape, or standalone (both are pictured below).

## Slider Making 

A Zipper Slider starts out
looking like this:

Raw metal.

The metal is melted down and sent to die casting molds.

They make a lot of sliders!

Then the pieces go through multiple polishing phases.

Lastly, some assembly of the flap and the zip.

The alignment process involves a properly shaped "needle" and a vibrating, spinning bowl.

A question you dread your child asking -- where do mannequins come from?

Well in today's blog, we'll find out!


This factory was very perspective changing. Usually, people think of China as
being for knock-off or unoriginal products, but the Mannequin Factory was
somewhat akin to a pop-art-at-scale Andy Warhol-esque plant. There were a lot of
original ideas and very skilled hand craftsmen. The company owner/head artist
was a very charismatic Chinese man, he gave us a really wonderful tour of his
facility!

Check out some of the really cool pieces designed here:

A mannequin starts with a sculptor making a small mockup to play with style and
form:

Then the sculptor produces a master mannequin:

From that mannequin, molds are made:

From the molds, mannequins are cast:

Casts are done using fiberglass

The factory operates at a pretty large scale!

A lot of casts being made!

I like this show because you can see casts being freshly opened and queued for
the next phase.

After casting, the mannequins are powdercoated/painted/glossed.

After painting, blemishes are marked and repaired:

Red tape is used to mark the faults.

Optionally, cosmetics (or other finishing touches) are applied:

The Archives:

They keep copies of various parts of mannequins that they have produced in the
past, in case they want to reference old work.

## Water Treatment

This factory also has an on-site water treatment facility

It was not quite as involved as the one at the leather treatment facility, but
this factory does do a lot of sanding and painting so they treat their waste
water on-site.

## Oddities

There are definitely odd things to see in a mannequin factory, or if not odd,
visually striking sights. Here are a few images, left without comment:

### Lastly

I got a really fantastic parting gift at this factory... an arm!

This will be fun to take through customs...

I'd love to do a project with it like turn it into a handy desk lamp. It's made
of a very nice quality wood.

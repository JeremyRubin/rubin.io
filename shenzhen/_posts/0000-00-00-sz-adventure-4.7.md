We visited a toy studio for a to-be-unnamed toy company (hence, no photos).
This place was really cool. Basically, big brands (and not just for toys,
clothes, electronics, etc) spec out a thing they want at a very high level,
such as "make me a toy that looks like a turtle". They then send it to a
prototyping studio who makes a turtle toy prototype and sends it back for
feedback. So the brands essentially monitor markets and tell the protypers what
to build to meet it.

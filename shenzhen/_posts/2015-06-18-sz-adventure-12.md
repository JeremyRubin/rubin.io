On Day 9 I mentioned that we had submitted our boards for Engineering Queries,
but I didn't quite explain what those are.

When you're working with a good manufacturer, they don't just blindly produce
what you tell them, they will go through and verify certain properties of the
design to make sure it will come out as expected, or even tell you ways you can
save costs that you may not have thought of. This is because:

1. they want your future business
2. they're just good people
3. they don't make more money on the more expensive process

3 can happen because a different process may have no different labor cost, but
just a material cost which they don't mark up. This is an important point to
keep in mind when working with various manufacturers -- they will pass savings
on to you if possible!

So you find yourself in China, and you want to go out in the evening. How can you be sure that your electronics aren't tampered with?

Use tamper evident seals!

Basically you go and buy a big plastic bin, tape over the edges,
paint glitter nailpolish over the tape, and take a picture. You can't get into the box without destroying the seals/re-aligning them perfectly.

"Reasonably Secure"

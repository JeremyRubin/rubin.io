The flight to Hong Kong was not bad at all! I think I slept most of the way. On
the flight I watched Chappie -- definitely go see it if you're a Die Antword
fan.

Upon arrival, I met up with Sean Cross and another student from the program. We
took a taxi &amp; the metro over to Shenzhen.

We quickly checked into our rooms and then, after getting frustrated with the
internet, I went to sleep.

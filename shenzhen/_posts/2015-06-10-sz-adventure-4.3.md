At this place we got to see them designing and making the molds. This was
pretty crazy to me! Basically you can 3D-model your part and then ship it to
them and they design a mold around it which has all the mechanical parts needed
to make the mold. Once the design is there, they will CNC mill it out roughly.
For finer details, they will do what's called Electric Deposition, where they
use a finely CNC'ed copper electrode in the mirror image of the design and
repeatedly tap it onto the mold with a massive current running. This eventually
cuts out the design layer by layer by blasting away the steel and copper.

With the guys from the printing press we got lunch in the middle of our tour.

We went to this lovely restuarant by the sea that had really fantastic seafood.

After lunch, we went to Shenzhen's Opium war musuem and saw some of the
exhibits.  It was really interesting to see the Chinese perspective on this
era, and the museum itself was interesting architecturally.

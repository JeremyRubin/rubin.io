For Day 23 we're going to take a look at a furniture factory. This is a HUGE
factory; probably the largest we saw on our trip, spanning many many hangars.
Unfortunately I didn't take too many pictures at this factory.

We start our journey in the furniture factory with some basic processing of raw materials:

The beams get cut up into little pieces and glued together.

All done!

Note the change of location!

While I was in Thailand visiting my friend there; I had the fortune of being
able to visit his family's rice processing factory. They're basically the
world's largest Thai Jasmine Rice processing company.

Then, an electronic separator uses jets of air to eliminate non rice things.

There is also some cool stuff going on to make sure the rice is of the right quality.

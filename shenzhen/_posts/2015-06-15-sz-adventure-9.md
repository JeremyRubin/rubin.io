Today we wrapped up our electrical changes to the orchard board. At the end of
the day, we submitted our boards for Engineering Queries and price quotes.

I also added some sweet graphics to my board, this is what is will look like:

One thing people often ask is how bad the pollution is... Actually Shenzhen is
basically a physically greener city than any other I've been to and the air is
very clear. Of course, some days are better than others, today was particularly
clear. What does suck is that everyone is smoking everywhere; that is probably
worse for the air quality than other factors.

After work, we went out to dinner at Coco Park, the notorious clubbing part of
Shenzhen. We didn't go clubbing, but we went to a pretty western-menued bar
&amp; grill for beers and dinner.
